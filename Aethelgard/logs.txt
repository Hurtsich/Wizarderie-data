", status="completed", output="# The Lore and History of Aethelgard

Aethelgard is a world balanced on the knife-edge of transformation, a realm where the echoes of ancient magic clash with the roar of burgeoning industry. Towering castles, steeped in centuries of tradition and the Old Power, now cast long shadows over soot-stained manufactories driven by the New Power of Artifice – steam, clockwork, and ingenuity. It is an age of gritty wonder, contrast, and consequence, where knights share the skies with sputtering airships, and the fate of nations hangs upon the volatile interplay between sorcery and steam.

## The Twin Continents and the Expanse

The known world is dominated by two major landmasses separated by a vast, turbulent ocean:

*   **Valoria:** The "Old Continent," heartland of established kingdoms, ancient forests like the deep Eldwood, and towering ranges like the Sky-Piercing Peaks. Valoria is steeped in history, its culture largely defined by feudal structures, noble houses often possessing innate magical abilities, and centers of traditional magical learning. Cities like **Aethelburg**, the Crown City, showcase gothic grandeur now increasingly interwoven with the grime and clatter of early industry. Yet, deep within the Eldwood lies the **Silverwood Lyceum**, a bastion of the Old Power, built into giant, magically sustained trees, fiercely resisting the encroachment of the modern age. Not all of Valoria clings to the past; the coastal city of **Ironhaven** has aggressively embraced Artifice, its skyline choked with smokestacks and its docks bustling with steam-powered cranes, a stark contrast to the magically potent but dangerous **Ruins of Eldoria** hidden in the Shadowfen marshes – remnants of a civilization lost to the Sundering. The formidable **Whispering Peaks** guard the north, rich in rare crystals and home to isolated monastic orders practicing elemental magic.
*   **Cogsworth:** The "New Continent," rediscovered only a century and a half ago across the Cerulean Expanse. It is a land of vast resources – coal, iron, exotic minerals – and untamed landscapes, from the dense **Whispering Jungle** to the arid **Great Gear Desert**, littered with colossal, ancient clockwork structures of unknown origin. Cogsworth is the crucible of the Artifice revolution, driven by ruthless exploitation and ambition. **Cogswright, the Gear-Heart City**, built around a massive geothermal vent, epitomizes this – a chaotic sprawl of factories and refineries controlled by the powerful Cogsworth Combine. **Port Valerius**, the main colonial gateway, reflects the clash of cultures, with Valorian architecture in its Old Quarter giving way to bustling docks and airship towers. The indigenous Sky-Whisper tribes hold sacred sites like **Sunstone Mesa**, a nexus of natural magic now threatened by Combine mining interests. The dangers of unchecked Artifice are starkly visible in the **Shattered Cog Mines**, a catastrophic ruin haunted by malfunctioning automatons and whispered conspiracies.
*   **The Cerulean Expanse:** The treacherous ocean separating the continents. Known for fierce storms, magical currents, and colossal sea beasts. Scattered archipelagos dot its surface, some rumored to be floating islands like **Sky-Dock Aeridor**, a major airship hub kept aloft by liftstone and Artifice, serving as a neutral port and haven for smugglers and sky-pirates.

## Factions Shaping the World

Power in Aethelgard is contested by numerous factions with conflicting goals:

*   **House Valerius:** Ruling from Aethelburg, this ancient noble house embodies Valoria's traditional feudal order. Led by King Theron Valerius III, they rely on land, lineage, and court magic, viewing Artifice with cautious skepticism as they seek to exploit Cogsworth's resources to bolster their waning influence.
*   **The Cogsworth Combine:** A ruthless consortium of industrialists and Artificer guilds headquartered in Cogswright. Driven by profit and technological dominance, they control much of Cogsworth's industry, suppress magic where inconvenient, and view traditional powers as obstacles. They pioneer advanced Artifice, often through exploitative means.
*   **The Eldwood Circle:** Based in the Silverwood Lyceum and sacred groves, this ancient order of druids and nature priests fights to preserve the Old Power and the natural world. Led by Archdruid Elara Willowwhisper, they see Artifice as a blight and use nature magic and sabotage to counter industrial expansion.
*   **The Gearbreakers:** A decentralized revolutionary movement operating in the industrial slums of cities like Ironhaven and Cogswright. Composed of disgruntled workers and idealistic radicals, they fight against the tyranny of both nobility and industry, using stolen Artifice and guerrilla tactics under leaders like the anonymous 'Captain Cog'.
*   **The Order of the Sacred Spark:** A newer religious sect, centered in Ironhaven, attempting to reconcile faith and Artifice. They believe technological ingenuity is a divine gift (the 'Sacred Spark') and seek to guide its development ethically, often clashing with traditionalists and the purely profit-driven Combine.
*   **The Syncretist Guild (Secretive):** A clandestine organization of rogue mages and artificers obsessed with mastering Arcanomechanics – the fusion of magic and technology. Operating in hidden labs, they conduct dangerous experiments, seeking forbidden knowledge and believing synthesis is the true path forward, hunted by traditionalists and mistrusted by mainstream factions.

## Defining Historical Events

Aethelgard's present is built upon the foundations of its tumultuous past:

*   **The Sundering (c. 1500 years ago):** A mysterious magical cataclysm that ended a prior golden age, reshaping continents, warping magic (creating areas like the Shadowfen and ruins like Eldoria), and burying vast amounts of knowledge about the Old Power. Its cause remains debated – war, divine wrath, failed experiment – but its legacy is felt in the world's ruins and the limits of current magical understanding.
*   **The Discovery of Cogsworth (c. 150 years ago):** Valorian explorers, aided perhaps by early Artifice ships, rediscovered the resource-rich continent across the Cerulean Expanse. This ignited an age of exploration, colonization, and exploitation, fueling the rise of Artifice and leading to conflict with indigenous peoples. Port Valerius was founded as the gateway.
*   **The Steam Uprising (c. 60 years ago):** Early Artificer guilds and merchant consortiums in Valoria used steam-powered automatons and primitive firearms to challenge noble authority. While not fully successful, these revolts demonstrated Artifice's military power, forced concessions from the nobility, and accelerated industrialization and the shift in power towards mercantile factions.
*   **The Valorian Succession War (c. 20-25 years ago):** A bloody civil war weakened the Valorian kingdoms, allowing House Valerius to secure the throne of Aethel but leaving the realm depleted. The chaos further empowered Artificer guilds and banking houses, many funded by Cogsworth's wealth, increasing their independence and influence.
*   **The Cogswright Disaster (c. 10 years ago):** A catastrophic explosion destroyed the Combine's primary resonant crystal mine, creating the Shattered Cog Mines. Officially blamed on geothermal instability, rumors persist of sabotage (Gearbreakers?), reckless Arcanomechanical experiments (Syncretist Guild?), or magical retaliation, fueling conspiracies and disrupting the supply of key components for advanced Artifice.
*   **The Printing Press Revolution (Ongoing):** The proliferation of the printing press, possibly enhanced by clockwork or minor magic, has accelerated the spread of knowledge, propaganda, and revolutionary ideas, challenging traditional authority and enabling factions like the Gearbreakers and the Order of the Sacred Spark to disseminate their messages widely.

## Secrets and Legends

Beneath the surface of progress and tradition lie mysteries that shape Aethelgard's destiny:

*   **The Heart of the World Engine:** A legendary Arcanomechanical artifact of immense power, rumored to predate the Sundering or be a creation of the Syncretist Guild. Its location is unknown, sought by the Combine for power and the Syncretists for knowledge, potentially hidden in Eldoria or the Great Gear Desert.
*   **The Shadow Weavers:** A clandestine intelligence network manipulating events from behind the scenes. Their ultimate goals are unknown, but their agents are embedded everywhere, trading secrets and orchestrating events attributed to others.
*   **The Iron Serpent Prophecy:** Cryptic verses speaking of an "Iron Serpent" (Artifice?) consuming the world and a "Starfall" renewing the Old Power. Its true meaning is fiercely debated, with factions twisting interpretations to suit their agendas.
*   **Lost Eldoria's True Secret:** Legends claim the pre-Sundering civilization achieved a perfect, stable synthesis of magic and 'living technology'. Rediscovering this secret could revolutionize Aethelgard, but perhaps the Sundering was meant to prevent its misuse.
*   **Cogbeard's Phantom Fleet:** The notorious sky-pirate Captain 'Cogbeard' Rourke vanished years ago. Rumors claim his heavily armed airship fleet and vast treasure hoard lie hidden within a perpetual storm in the Cerulean Expanse or at a secret floating island.
*   **The Truth of the Cogswright Disaster:** The official story is a lie. Was it Gearbreaker sabotage, a failed Combine weapon experiment, a Syncretist Guild catastrophe involving planar entities, or retaliation by Sky-Whisper shamans? Uncovering the truth could ignite new conflicts.

In Aethelgard, adventure awaits at the crossroads of magic and machine. Heroes must navigate treacherous landscapes, political intrigue, and the fundamental conflict between the Old Ways and the New Power, forging their own legends amidst the smoke and sparks of a changing world."

*   **One Minor Action:** Draw/stow a weapon, open/close a door, speak a short phrase, interact with a simple object, activate a simple gadget feature.
*   **Movement:** Move up to your Speed (typically 30 feet). Can be broken up before/after actions.
*   **One Reaction:** Used outside your turn in response to a trigger (e.g., Opportunity Attack when an enemy leaves your reach, casting a reaction spell).

## 2. Combat System

### Structure

*   **Initiative:** At the start of combat, everyone rolls a d20 + DEX modifier. The results determine the turn order, highest to lowest.
*   **Turns:** Combat proceeds in rounds. On your turn, you take actions as per the Action Economy.
*   **Surprise:** If unaware of enemies, a character might be Surprised and unable to act on their first turn. Determined by GM based on Stealth vs. Perception.

### Actions in Combat

*   **Attack:** Make a melee or ranged attack roll (d20 + STR/DEX Mod + Proficiency Bonus) against the target's AC. On a hit, roll damage.
*   **Cast Spell:** Use a Standard Action (usually) to cast a spell. Requires concentration, components, or other resources as defined by the spell.
*   **Use Gadget:** Activate a technological device. May require a Standard or Minor action, potentially a skill check (e.g., Mechanics), and might consume charges/fuel.
*   **Defend:** Use a Standard Action to take the Dodge action, improving your defenses.
*   **Move:** Use your movement speed. Difficult terrain costs double movement. Standing up from prone costs half your movement.

### Damage & Defense

*   **Armor Class (AC):** Represents how hard you are to hit.
    *   **AC = 10 + Armor Bonus + Dexterity Modifier (up to armor's max DEX bonus) + Shield Bonus + Other Modifiers.**
*   **Hit Points (HP):** Represents your health and resilience. Determined by origin/class and CON modifier. Reaches 0 HP = unconscious and dying. Reaches negative HP equal to max HP = dead.
*   **Damage Types:**
    *   **Physical:** Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing (non-magical weapons, impacts).
    *   **Fire:** Flames, heat.
    *   **Frost:** Ice, cold.
    *   **Electrical:** Lightning, galvanic energy.
    *   **Arcane:** Raw magical energy, force effects.
    *   **Clockwork/Force:** Damage from crushing gears, steam pressure, kinetic impacts from Artifice.
    *   **Poison/Acid:** Corrosive or toxic substances.
*   **Resistance/Vulnerability:** Some creatures/armor might resist (take half damage) or be vulnerable (take double damage) to certain types.

### Critical Hits / Fumbles

*   **Critical Hit (Natural 20):** Rolling a 20 on an attack roll automatically hits. Roll double the damage dice for the attack.
    *   *Steampunk Flair:* A critical hit with a Steam Hammer might knock the target prone from the impact; a Galvanic Pistol crit might cause lingering electrical arcs (minor ongoing damage).
*   **Critical Fumble (Natural 1):** Rolling a 1 on an attack roll automatically misses. The GM may introduce a minor complication.
    *   *Steampunk Flair:* A fumble with a Clockwork Crossbow might jam the loading mechanism (requires Minor Action to clear); a fumble using a complex Gadget might cause it to sputter, malfunction temporarily, or consume extra fuel/charge. *Avoid overly punishing fumbles.*

### Steampunk Weapons (Examples)

*   **Steam Hammer (Melee):** Heavy, requires STR. Deals high Bludgeoning/Force damage. Might have a 'Vent Steam' feature (Minor Action) for a small burst of area damage or knockback.
*   **Clockwork Crossbow (Ranged):** Uses DEX. Fires bolts (Piercing). May have an auto-loading mechanism allowing multiple shots (potentially as one Standard Action, or reducing reload time). Prone to jamming on a fumble.
*   **Galvanic Pistol (Ranged):** Uses DEX. Deals Electrical damage. Range might be shorter than a standard pistol. Requires energy cells or winding.
*   **Pneumatic Gauntlet (Melee):** Uses STR. Deals Bludgeoning/Force damage. Can be used to grapple with advantage.
*   **Alchemical Sprayer (Ranged):** Uses DEX. Fires cones or lines of alchemical substances (Acid, Fire, Adhesive). Limited shots per canister.

## 3. Magic and Technology

### Spellcasting (Old Power)

*   **Source:** Drawing upon the ambient magical energies of the world or specific pacts/traditions (e.g., Valorian elementalism, Eldwood nature spirits).
*   **Resource:** **Mana Points (MP).** Calculated based on level and Wisdom modifier (e.g., MP = 4 + Level + WIS Mod). Spells cost MP to cast. MP regenerates during rests (e.g., half on short rest, full on long rest).
*   **Casting:** Requires a Standard Action (usually), concentration for some spells, and potentially verbal/somatic/material components. Spellcasters know a certain number of spells and can prepare a subset each day (GM determines specifics based on character concept).
*   **Spellcasting Ability:** Wisdom is typically used for Old Power spellcasting checks and determining spell save DCs (DC = 8 + Proficiency Bonus + WIS Mod).
*   **Example Spells:**
    *   *Flicker (Cantrip):* Create a small flame or spark.
    *   *Mend Wood (Level 1):* Repair simple wooden objects (Valorian/Eldwood).
    *   *Stone Shield (Level 1):* Briefly increase AC by conjuring earthen protection (Valorian).
    *   *Entangling Vines (Level 1):* Restrain creatures in an area with magical plants (Eldwood).
    *   *Static Discharge (Level 1):* Zap a target with minor Electrical damage (Valorian Storm Magic).

### Gadgeteering / Artifice (New Power)

*   **Source:** Applying principles of mechanics, alchemy, steam power, and clockwork to create devices. Primarily associated with Cogsworth and Artificers.
*   **Crafting:** Requires time, resources (scrap, components, fuel), appropriate tools (Tinker's Tools, Alchemist's Supplies), and a successful **Mechanics (INT)** check. DC depends on complexity. Failure might waste resources or create a flawed device.
*   **Usage:** Gadgets often have limited uses (**Charges** or **Fuel**). Using a gadget might require a Standard or Minor Action.
*   **Malfunction:** On a critical fumble (Natural 1) when using a complex gadget, or sometimes when pushed beyond limits (GM discretion), it might malfunction. Roll on a simple table (e.g., 1-2: Depleted, needs repair/refuel; 3-4: Jammed, needs Minor Action; 5: Minor explosion/backfire, user takes minimal damage; 6: Breaks completely).
*   **Gadgeteering Ability:** Intellect is typically used for crafting and understanding technology.
*   **Example Gadgets:**
    *   *Clockwork Owl:* Provides scouting, delivers messages. Limited operational time per winding (Charges). Requires Mechanics check to build.
    *   *Grappling Hook Launcher:* Fires a hook and line. Requires DEX check to aim, STR check to climb. Uses compressed air/steam (Fuel).
    *   *Alchemical Grenade (Acid/Fire/Smoke):* Thrown weapon, area effect. Consumed on use. Requires Alchemy check to craft.
    *   *Steam-Assisted Actuators (Armor Mod):* Increases Strength score or carrying capacity temporarily. Consumes steam pressure (Fuel). Requires Mechanics check to install.

### Arcanomechanics (Syncretist Guild)

*   **Source:** The deliberate fusion of Old Power magic with New Power technology.
*   **Mechanics:** Often involves enchanting technological components or using magical energy to power devices. Requires proficiency in both **Spellcraft** and **Mechanics**.
*   **Crafting:** Requires rare materials (e.g., magically resonant crystals, enchanted metals), specific rituals or blueprints, and successful checks in both skills (often with high DCs).
*   **Usage:** Arcanomechanical devices might use Mana Points, special arcane charges, or have unique activation methods. They can often replicate spell effects or achieve results neither magic nor tech alone could manage.
*   **Example Arcanomechanics:**
    *   *Magically Charged Power Cell:* Stores MP that can be used to power certain gadgets or release as raw energy. Requires Spellcraft (INT or WIS) to charge.
    *   *Enchanted Clockwork Limb:* Replaces a lost limb, functions like a normal limb but might have minor magical enhancements (e.g., resistance to cold, slightly increased STR). Requires attunement.
    *   *Elemental Steam Engine:* An airship engine infused with an air or fire elemental, providing greater speed or efficiency but potentially unstable. Requires specific rituals to bind/maintain.
    *   *Runic Targeting Scope:* Attachable to ranged weapons. Uses minor magic (perhaps 1 MP per shot) to grant advantage on the attack roll.

## 4. Optional Systems (Keep Simple)

### Advanced Options (Character Paths)

These represent specialized training or focus beyond basic origins. Gained through leveling or specific story achievements. Provide a small package of thematic abilities or skill proficiencies.

*   **Artificer Specialist:** Gains expertise in Mechanics, learns schematics for advanced gadgets faster, potentially gains a signature clockwork companion.
*   **Eldwood Druid:** Gains ability to Wild Shape into natural beasts, learns more nature-focused Old Power spells, gains proficiency in Nature/Survival.
*   **Gearbreaker Saboteur:** Gains expertise in Stealth and Mechanics (for disabling), proficiency with explosives, advantage on checks to sabotage machinery.
*   **Syncretist Adept:** Gains proficiency in Arcanomechanics (if not already known), learns unique Arcanomechanical crafting recipes, potentially gains ability to channel MP into devices.

### Equipment Customization

*   **Mechanics:** Requires appropriate tools, time, resources (cost determined by GM), and a successful skill check (usually Mechanics or Alchemy). DC based on complexity.
*   **Process:** Player describes desired modification. GM sets DC, cost, and time.
*   **Examples:**
    *   *Adding Scope to Crossbow:* Mechanics DC 13, cost 50 Cogs, 1 hour. Grants +1 to attack rolls at longer ranges.
    *   *Reinforcing Armor Plates:* Mechanics DC 15, cost 100 Cogs + materials, 4 hours. Increases Armor Bonus by +1, might add weight or slightly reduce max DEX bonus.
    *   *Overclocking Steam Engine:* Mechanics DC 16, cost varies, 2 hours. Increases speed/power output temporarily but increases Malfunction chance or fuel consumption. Requires check each time it's pushed.

### Faction Rules

*   **Reputation:** Track reputation with key factions on a simple scale (e.g., -3 Hostile, -2 Unfriendly, -1 Neutral, 0 Indifferent, +1 Friendly, +2 Allied, +3 Revered). Actions in the game adjust these scores.
*   **Benefits:** Positive reputation grants access to benefits:
    *   *+1 Friendly:* Access to faction-specific common gear/information, minor favors.
    *   *+2 Allied:* Access to restricted areas/safe houses, discounts on faction goods/services, potential for faction backup on missions.
    *   *+3 Revered:* Access to rare/powerful faction equipment or secrets, significant political influence within the faction, high-level support.
*   **Drawbacks:** Negative reputation leads to suspicion, hostility, refusal of service, or active opposition from the faction.

## 5. Edge Cases & Examples

1.  **Combat on a Moving Airship:**
    *   **Environment:** The deck is the battlefield. Strong winds might impose disadvantage on ranged attacks or require DEX checks to avoid being blown overboard (DC 10-15 depending on severity/altitude).
    *   **Movement:** Moving on the deck is normal. Climbing rigging requires Athletics checks. Falling overboard is likely fatal unless countermeasures (e.g., Feather Fall spell, grappling hook) are used.
    *   **Ship Actions:** The pilot uses their turn to control the ship (Airship Piloting checks). Damage to critical ship parts (engine, rudder, envelope) can have major consequences (loss of altitude, reduced speed, fire). Large weapons (cannons) might require multiple crew members (actions) to operate.

2.  **Using Artifice to Disable a Magical Ward:**
    *   **Direct Disabling:** Generally, Artifice cannot directly dispel or disable purely magical effects like a ward. Technology operates on physical/mechanical principles, while magic operates on arcane ones.
    *   **Indirect Methods:** Artifice *could* be used indirectly.
        *   **Overload:** A powerful electrical discharge (Galvanic device) or concussive blast (Alchemical grenade) *might* temporarily disrupt the ward's matrix if the GM rules the ward has a physical anchor or is susceptible to such interference (requires high Mechanics/Alchemy check vs. Spell Save DC of the ward). Success might only suppress it for a round or two.
        *   **Bypass:** A gadget might allow bypassing the ward physically (e.g., a device that drills through the warded wall, bypassing the magical barrier on the door).
        *   **Arcanomechanics:** A device specifically designed using Arcanomechanics (e.g., a 'Runic Nullifier') *could* potentially interact with and disable magical wards, likely requiring an Arcanomechanics skill check vs. the ward's Spell Save DC and consuming significant power/charges.

3.  **Combat with a Large Steam-Powered Golem:**
    *   **Scale:** The golem is Large or Huge, granting it advantages (reach, potentially more attacks/damage) but making it an easier target (lower AC due to size, unless heavily armored). It likely has high STR and CON, lots of HP, and potentially damage resistance to physical attacks.
    *   **Targeting:** Players might target specific weak points identified via successful Investigation or Mechanics checks (e.g., hydraulic joints, boiler unit, sensor array). Hitting these might require a 'called shot' (attack at disadvantage or vs. higher AC) but could impose conditions (reduced speed, disable a weapon, cause steam leak).
    *   **Golem Actions:** Might include powerful slams (Bludgeoning/Force), steam vents (Fire damage cone), grappling, or integrated weapons.
    *   **Vulnerabilities:** Likely vulnerable to Electrical damage (shorting circuits) or extreme Cold (making metal brittle).
