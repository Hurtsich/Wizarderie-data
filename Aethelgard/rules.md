# Aethelgard RPG: Simplified Ruleset

This ruleset provides a streamlined framework for playing campaigns in the steampunk fantasy world of Aethelgard. It balances ease of play with thematic depth, focusing on the interplay between ancient magic (Old Power) and burgeoning technology (Artifice/New Power).

## 1. Core Mechanics

### Character Creation

1.  **Concept & Origin:** Choose your character's core concept and origin. Are they a noble from Valoria, a gear-savvy inventor from Cogsworth, a nature-warden from the Eldwood, or affiliated with a specific faction (e.g., Gearbreakers, Syncretist Guild)? Your origin grants starting benefits.
    *   **Example Origin - Cogsworth Engineer:** +1 Intellect, Proficiency in Mechanics and Tinker's Tools, Starting Gear: Wrench (Light Melee Weapon), Basic Toolkit, Worker's Clothes, 1d10 Cogs (currency).
    *   **Example Origin - Valorian Initiate:** +1 Wisdom, Proficiency in Spellcraft and History, Starting Gear: Staff (Simple Melee Weapon), Initiate's Robes, Scroll Case with 2 basic Cantrips, 1d10 Sovereigns (currency).
2.  **Ability Scores:** Determine your six core ability scores. Use the **Standard Array** (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) and assign these scores to your abilities. Apply any origin bonus.
3.  **Skills & Proficiency:** Choose a number of skill proficiencies based on your concept/background (e.g., 3 + Intellect modifier). Your **Proficiency Bonus** starts at +2 and increases at higher levels (GM discretion, e.g., +3 at level 5, +4 at level 9).
4.  **Equipment:** Note your starting equipment from your origin. You may have additional starting funds (GM determines amount) to purchase gear from the equipment list.
5.  **Finishing Touches:** Calculate Hit Points (HP), Armor Class (AC), initiative bonus, and note down any special abilities from your origin or choices. Give your character a name and backstory!

### Action Economy

On your turn, you can typically perform:
*   **One Standard Action:** Attack, Cast a Spell, Use a complex Gadget, Stabilize a dying creature, Dash (double move), Disengage (move without provoking opportunity attacks), Dodge (impose disadvantage on attackers), Help (grant advantage to an ally), Hide, Search.
*   **One Minor Action:** Draw/stow a weapon, open/close a door, speak a short phrase, interact with a simple object, activate a simple gadget feature.
*   **Movement:** Move up to your Speed (typically 30 feet). Can be broken up before/after actions.
*   **One Reaction:** Used outside your turn in response to a trigger (e.g., Opportunity Attack when an enemy leaves your reach, casting a reaction spell).

## 2. Combat System

### Structure

*   **Initiative:** At the start of combat, everyone rolls a d20 + DEX modifier. The results determine the turn order, highest to lowest.
*   **Turns:** Combat proceeds in rounds. On your turn, you take actions as per the Action Economy.
*   **Surprise:** If unaware of enemies, a character might be Surprised and unable to act on their first turn. Determined by GM based on Stealth vs. Perception.

### Actions in Combat

*   **Attack:** Make a melee or ranged attack roll (d20 + STR/DEX Mod + Proficiency Bonus) against the target's AC. On a hit, roll damage.
*   **Cast Spell:** Use a Standard Action (usually) to cast a spell. Requires concentration, components, or other resources as defined by the spell.
*   **Use Gadget:** Activate a technological device. May require a Standard or Minor action, potentially a skill check (e.g., Mechanics), and might consume charges/fuel.
*   **Defend:** Use a Standard Action to take the Dodge action, improving your defenses.
*   **Move:** Use your movement speed. Difficult terrain costs double movement. Standing up from prone costs half your movement.

### Damage & Defense

*   **Armor Class (AC):** Represents how hard you are to hit.
    *   **AC = 10 + Armor Bonus + Dexterity Modifier (up to armor's max DEX bonus) + Shield Bonus + Other Modifiers.**
*   **Hit Points (HP):** Represents your health and resilience. Determined by origin/class and CON modifier. Reaches 0 HP = unconscious and dying. Reaches negative HP equal to max HP = dead.
*   **Damage Types:**
    *   **Physical:** Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing (non-magical weapons, impacts).
    *   **Fire:** Flames, heat.
    *   **Frost:** Ice, cold.
    *   **Electrical:** Lightning, galvanic energy.
    *   **Arcane:** Raw magical energy, force effects.
    *   **Clockwork/Force:** Damage from crushing gears, steam pressure, kinetic impacts from Artifice.
    *   **Poison/Acid:** Corrosive or toxic substances.
*   **Resistance/Vulnerability:** Some creatures/armor might resist (take half damage) or be vulnerable (take double damage) to certain types.

### Critical Hits / Fumbles

*   **Critical Hit (Natural 20):** Rolling a 20 on an attack roll automatically hits. Roll double the damage dice for the attack.
    *   *Steampunk Flair:* A critical hit with a Steam Hammer might knock the target prone from the impact; a Galvanic Pistol crit might cause lingering electrical arcs (minor ongoing damage).
*   **Critical Fumble (Natural 1):** Rolling a 1 on an attack roll automatically misses. The GM may introduce a minor complication.
    *   *Steampunk Flair:* A fumble with a Clockwork Crossbow might jam the loading mechanism (requires Minor Action to clear); a fumble using a complex Gadget might cause it to sputter, malfunction temporarily, or consume extra fuel/charge. *Avoid overly punishing fumbles.*

### Steampunk Weapons (Examples)

*   **Steam Hammer (Melee):** Heavy, requires STR. Deals high Bludgeoning/Force damage. Might have a 'Vent Steam' feature (Minor Action) for a small burst of area damage or knockback.
*   **Clockwork Crossbow (Ranged):** Uses DEX. Fires bolts (Piercing). May have an auto-loading mechanism allowing multiple shots (potentially as one Standard Action, or reducing reload time). Prone to jamming on a fumble.
*   **Galvanic Pistol (Ranged):** Uses DEX. Deals Electrical damage. Range might be shorter than a standard pistol. Requires energy cells or winding.
*   **Pneumatic Gauntlet (Melee):** Uses STR. Deals Bludgeoning/Force damage. Can be used to grapple with advantage.
*   **Alchemical Sprayer (Ranged):** Uses DEX. Fires cones or lines of alchemical substances (Acid, Fire, Adhesive). Limited shots per canister.

## 3. Magic and Technology

### Spellcasting (Old Power)

*   **Source:** Drawing upon the ambient magical energies of the world or specific pacts/traditions (e.g., Valorian elementalism, Eldwood nature spirits).
*   **Resource:** **Mana Points (MP).** Calculated based on level and Wisdom modifier (e.g., MP = 4 + Level + WIS Mod). Spells cost MP to cast. MP regenerates during rests (e.g., half on short rest, full on long rest).
*   **Casting:** Requires a Standard Action (usually), concentration for some spells, and potentially verbal/somatic/material components. Spellcasters know a certain number of spells and can prepare a subset each day (GM determines specifics based on character concept).
*   **Spellcasting Ability:** Wisdom is typically used for Old Power spellcasting checks and determining spell save DCs (DC = 8 + Proficiency Bonus + WIS Mod).
*   **Example Spells:**
    *   *Flicker (Cantrip):* Create a small flame or spark.
    *   *Mend Wood (Level 1):* Repair simple wooden objects (Valorian/Eldwood).
    *   *Stone Shield (Level 1):* Briefly increase AC by conjuring earthen protection (Valorian).
    *   *Entangling Vines (Level 1):* Restrain creatures in an area with magical plants (Eldwood).
    *   *Static Discharge (Level 1):* Zap a target with minor Electrical damage (Valorian Storm Magic).

### Gadgeteering / Artifice (New Power)

*   **Source:** Applying principles of mechanics, alchemy, steam power, and clockwork to create devices. Primarily associated with Cogsworth and Artificers.
*   **Crafting:** Requires time, resources (scrap, components, fuel), appropriate tools (Tinker's Tools, Alchemist's Supplies), and a successful **Mechanics (INT)** check. DC depends on complexity. Failure might waste resources or create a flawed device.
*   **Usage:** Gadgets often have limited uses (**Charges** or **Fuel**). Using a gadget might require a Standard or Minor Action.
*   **Malfunction:** On a critical fumble (Natural 1) when using a complex gadget, or sometimes when pushed beyond limits (GM discretion), it might malfunction. Roll on a simple table (e.g., 1-2: Depleted, needs repair/refuel; 3-4: Jammed, needs Minor Action; 5: Minor explosion/backfire, user takes minimal damage; 6: Breaks completely).
*   **Gadgeteering Ability:** Intellect is typically used for crafting and understanding technology.
*   **Example Gadgets:**
    *   *Clockwork Owl:* Provides scouting, delivers messages. Limited operational time per winding (Charges). Requires Mechanics check to build.
    *   *Grappling Hook Launcher:* Fires a hook and line. Requires DEX check to aim, STR check to climb. Uses compressed air/steam (Fuel).
    *   *Alchemical Grenade (Acid/Fire/Smoke):* Thrown weapon, area effect. Consumed on use. Requires Alchemy check to craft.
    *   *Steam-Assisted Actuators (Armor Mod):* Increases Strength score or carrying capacity temporarily. Consumes steam pressure (Fuel). Requires Mechanics check to install.

### Arcanomechanics (Syncretist Guild)

*   **Source:** The deliberate fusion of Old Power magic with New Power technology.
*   **Mechanics:** Often involves enchanting technological components or using magical energy to power devices. Requires proficiency in both **Spellcraft** and **Mechanics**.
*   **Crafting:** Requires rare materials (e.g., magically resonant crystals, enchanted metals), specific rituals or blueprints, and successful checks in both skills (often with high DCs).
*   **Usage:** Arcanomechanical devices might use Mana Points, special arcane charges, or have unique activation methods. They can often replicate spell effects or achieve results neither magic nor tech alone could manage.
*   **Example Arcanomechanics:**
    *   *Magically Charged Power Cell:* Stores MP that can be used to power certain gadgets or release as raw energy. Requires Spellcraft (INT or WIS) to charge.
    *   *Enchanted Clockwork Limb:* Replaces a lost limb, functions like a normal limb but might have minor magical enhancements (e.g., resistance to cold, slightly increased STR). Requires attunement.
    *   *Elemental Steam Engine:* An airship engine infused with an air or fire elemental, providing greater speed or efficiency but potentially unstable. Requires specific rituals to bind/maintain.
    *   *Runic Targeting Scope:* Attachable to ranged weapons. Uses minor magic (perhaps 1 MP per shot) to grant advantage on the attack roll.

## 4. Optional Systems (Keep Simple)

### Advanced Options (Character Paths)

These represent specialized training or focus beyond basic origins. Gained through leveling or specific story achievements. Provide a small package of thematic abilities or skill proficiencies.

*   **Artificer Specialist:** Gains expertise in Mechanics, learns schematics for advanced gadgets faster, potentially gains a signature clockwork companion.
*   **Eldwood Druid:** Gains ability to Wild Shape into natural beasts, learns more nature-focused Old Power spells, gains proficiency in Nature/Survival.
*   **Gearbreaker Saboteur:** Gains expertise in Stealth and Mechanics (for disabling), proficiency with explosives, advantage on checks to sabotage machinery.
*   **Syncretist Adept:** Gains proficiency in Arcanomechanics (if not already known), learns unique Arcanomechanical crafting recipes, potentially gains ability to channel MP into devices.

### Equipment Customization

*   **Mechanics:** Requires appropriate tools, time, resources (cost determined by GM), and a successful skill check (usually Mechanics or Alchemy). DC based on complexity.
*   **Process:** Player describes desired modification. GM sets DC, cost, and time.
*   **Examples:**
    *   *Adding Scope to Crossbow:* Mechanics DC 13, cost 50 Cogs, 1 hour. Grants +1 to attack rolls at longer ranges.
    *   *Reinforcing Armor Plates:* Mechanics DC 15, cost 100 Cogs + materials, 4 hours. Increases Armor Bonus by +1, might add weight or slightly reduce max DEX bonus.
    *   *Overclocking Steam Engine:* Mechanics DC 16, cost varies, 2 hours. Increases speed/power output temporarily but increases Malfunction chance or fuel consumption. Requires check each time it's pushed.

### Faction Rules

*   **Reputation:** Track reputation with key factions on a simple scale (e.g., -3 Hostile, -2 Unfriendly, -1 Neutral, 0 Indifferent, +1 Friendly, +2 Allied, +3 Revered). Actions in the game adjust these scores.
*   **Benefits:** Positive reputation grants access to benefits:
    *   *+1 Friendly:* Access to faction-specific common gear/information, minor favors.
    *   *+2 Allied:* Access to restricted areas/safe houses, discounts on faction goods/services, potential for faction backup on missions.
    *   *+3 Revered:* Access to rare/powerful faction equipment or secrets, significant political influence within the faction, high-level support.
*   **Drawbacks:** Negative reputation leads to suspicion, hostility, refusal of service, or active opposition from the faction.

## 5. Edge Cases & Examples

1.  **Combat on a Moving Airship:**
    *   **Environment:** The deck is the battlefield. Strong winds might impose disadvantage on ranged attacks or require DEX checks to avoid being blown overboard (DC 10-15 depending on severity/altitude).
    *   **Movement:** Moving on the deck is normal. Climbing rigging requires Athletics checks. Falling overboard is likely fatal unless countermeasures (e.g., Feather Fall spell, grappling hook) are used.
    *   **Ship Actions:** The pilot uses their turn to control the ship (Airship Piloting checks). Damage to critical ship parts (engine, rudder, envelope) can have major consequences (loss of altitude, reduced speed, fire). Large weapons (cannons) might require multiple crew members (actions) to operate.

2.  **Using Artifice to Disable a Magical Ward:**
    *   **Direct Disabling:** Generally, Artifice cannot directly dispel or disable purely magical effects like a ward. Technology operates on physical/mechanical principles, while magic operates on arcane ones.
    *   **Indirect Methods:** Artifice *could* be used indirectly.
        *   **Overload:** A powerful electrical discharge (Galvanic device) or concussive blast (Alchemical grenade) *might* temporarily disrupt the ward's matrix if the GM rules the ward has a physical anchor or is susceptible to such interference (requires high Mechanics/Alchemy check vs. Spell Save DC of the ward). Success might only suppress it for a round or two.
        *   **Bypass:** A gadget might allow bypassing the ward physically (e.g., a device that drills through the warded wall, bypassing the magical barrier on the door).
        *   **Arcanomechanics:** A device specifically designed using Arcanomechanics (e.g., a 'Runic Nullifier') *could* potentially interact with and disable magical wards, likely requiring an Arcanomechanics skill check vs. the ward's Spell Save DC and consuming significant power/charges.

3.  **Combat with a Large Steam-Powered Golem:**
    *   **Scale:** The golem is Large or Huge, granting it advantages (reach, potentially more attacks/damage) but making it an easier target (lower AC due to size, unless heavily armored). It likely has high STR and CON, lots of HP, and potentially damage resistance to physical attacks.
    *   **Targeting:** Players might target specific weak points identified via successful Investigation or Mechanics checks (e.g., hydraulic joints, boiler unit, sensor array). Hitting these might require a 'called shot' (attack at disadvantage or vs. higher AC) but could impose conditions (reduced speed, disable a weapon, cause steam leak).
    *   **Golem Actions:** Might include powerful slams (Bludgeoning/Force), steam vents (Fire damage cone), grappling, or integrated weapons.
    *   **Vulnerabilities:** Likely vulnerable to Electrical damage (shorting circuits) or extreme Cold (making metal brittle). Its boiler might be a critical weak point; rupturing it (perhaps via a critical hit or targeted attack) could cause a massive explosion or disable the golem. Magic like *Heat Metal* could be very effective against its chassis. Artifice might be used to jam joints (Mechanics check) or overload systems.
