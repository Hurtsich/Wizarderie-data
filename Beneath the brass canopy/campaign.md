# Beneath the Brass Canopy: Campaign Design Document

## Campaign Overview

**Concept:** *Beneath the Brass Canopy* is an RPG campaign centered around the first official expedition in generations from **Aethelburg**, a magnificent steampunk city floating high above the clouds, down to the mysterious, unexplored surface world below. The city's inhabitants subsist on legends and fragmented histories, largely ignorant of the reality beneath them. Players take on the roles of explorers, scientists, engineers, and guards hand-picked (or perhaps self-selected) for this perilous voyage into the unknown.

**Logline:** Tasked with the first descent in centuries, explorers from the magnificent steampunk sky-city of Aethelburg must survive the unknown wonders and horrors of the surface world, returning with truths that could uplift or shatter their suspended society.

**Central Conflict:** The campaign revolves around the tension between **Exploration vs. Survival**, the **Known vs. the Unknown**, the stark contrast between Aethelburg's intricate **Steampunk Technology and the potentially wild, alien, or ruined Surface World**, and the burgeoning **Political Conflict** within Aethelburg as factions vie to control the narrative and resources stemming from the expedition's discoveries.

**Mood:** A blend of **Awe & Wonder** (gazing upon Aethelburg, descending through clouds, initial surface discoveries), **Mystery & Trepidation** (what lies below? why do we float?), **Adventure & Peril** (navigating unknown terrain, facing surface threats), and **Political Intrigue** (reporting findings, dealing with rival agendas within the expedition and back in Aethelburg).

**Primary Themes:**
1.  **Discovery & The Fear of the Unknown:** Charting the uncharted, confronting preconceived notions born from myth, and facing the psychological toll of true isolation and the alien.
2.  **Hubris & Consequences:** Exploring *why* Aethelburg floats. Was it ambition, necessity, or escape? What was the cost? Are the city's foundations (literal or metaphorical) stable?
3.  **Truth & Manipulation:** The power of information. How discoveries are interpreted, reported, potentially censored or weaponized by political factions back in Aethelburg (e.g., Isolationists vs. Expansionists vs. Resource Exploiters).
4.  **Nature vs. Machine:** The juxtaposition of Aethelburg's complex clockwork, steam, and brass technology against the potentially untamed, overgrown, mutated, or magically infused environment of the surface. Which is truly more resilient?
5.  **Adaptation & Survival:** Players must adapt Aethelburg methods and tech to survive the surface, possibly learning new ways from the environment or its inhabitants (if any).

## Campaign Structure

The campaign follows a three-arc structure, charting the expedition's journey from launch to potential return and its consequences.

**Arc 1: The Grand Descent (Levels ~1-5)**
*   **Focus:** Introduction to Aethelburg society and technology, the expedition's launch, the perilous journey downwards, establishing a foothold on the surface, initial exploration, and survival challenges.
*   **Key Beats:**
    1.  **The Commissioning/Embarkation:** Players are introduced, receive their mission briefing from Aethelburg authorities (e.g., Councilor Aris Thorne, the Exploration Cog-Guild), and board the expedition's primary vessel (designed by Chief Artificer Veridian Flux). Fanfare and political maneuvering in Aethelburg are visible.
    2.  **Breaching the Canopy:** The harrowing descent through the perpetual cloud layer – potentially featuring turbulence, strange atmospheric phenomena, navigational hazards, or encounters with bizarre cloud-dwelling creatures hinted at in legends. Testing the limits of Aethelburg tech.
    3.  **First Landing:** Setting down on the surface (perhaps near The Verdant Maze, The Whispering Salt Flats, or The Chronarium Wreckage). The initial moments of sensory input – alien smells, strange gravity(?), bizarre flora, unsettling silence or overwhelming noise. Establishing a secure base camp under Guild-Captain Vance's supervision.
    4.  **Initial Reconnaissance:** Short-range patrols, cataloging immediate environment, facing first surface dangers (predatory wildlife, treacherous terrain, hazardous atmospheric pockets). Discovering the basics of survival in this new world.
    5.  **The First Anomaly:** Finding something unexpected that doesn't fit Aethelburg's myths – a strangely preserved ruin within the Verdant Maze, the source of the hum in the Salt Flats, a functioning component in the Chronarium Wreckage. This discovery raises the stakes and attracts attention (potentially internal conflict between Thorne's agents, Veridian's curiosity, and Vance's objectives).

**Arc 2: Echoes from Below (Levels ~6-10)**
*   **Focus:** Deeper exploration into the surface world, uncovering significant landmarks or civilizations (lost or active), finding clues relating to Aethelburg's past and reason for ascent, managing dwindling resources, and dealing with internal expedition conflicts or external interference from Aethelburg.
*   **Key Beats:**
    1.  **Mapping the Unknown:** Venturing further, potentially discovering other key locations. Logistical challenges mount.
    2.  **Whispers of the Past:** Finding substantial evidence related to why Aethelburg ascended – perhaps data cores in the Chronarium Wreckage, preserved murals in the Verdant Maze, or resonant echoes in the Salt Flats hinting at a cataclysm.
    3.  **Contact?:** Encountering sentient surface dwellers (if they exist). First contact protocols tested, potentially influenced by Thorne's caution, Veridian's eagerness, or Vance's suspicion.
    4.  **Supply Chain Pressure:** Resources from Aethelburg dwindle or are cut off (accidentally or deliberately by Thorne's faction?). The expedition must become more self-sufficient, relying on surface resources (Veridian adapts tech, Vance secures resources). Internal tensions rise.
    5.  **Interference from Above:** Receiving conflicting orders from Thorne vs. other Council factions. Perhaps a rival Guild vessel arrives, challenging Vance's authority or Veridian's findings. Sabotage from Thorne's agents becomes a real threat.

**Arc 3: The Surface Truth & The Sky-Bound Reckoning (Levels ~11+)**
*   **Focus:** Uncovering the central truth about the surface world and Aethelburg's relationship to it. Making a critical decision about this truth's dissemination. The potential return journey and confronting the political fallout in Aethelburg, or choosing a different path.
*   **Key Beats:**
    1.  **The Core Revelation:** Discovering the fundamental truth (e.g., Aethelburg's power source requires surface components found only in hazardous zones, the city founders caused the surface state, the surface holds a cure for Aethelburg's 'Sky-Lung' disease).
    2.  **Point of No Return:** A major event forces a decision – Veridian's vessel critically damaged, Vance receives orders to silence the expedition, discovery of a truth Thorne cannot allow back.
    3.  **Faction Endgame on the Surface:** Rival factions within the expedition (Thorne loyalists, Veridian's science-first group, Vance's security/Guild faction, player-led group) clash over the discovered truth and future actions.
    4.  **The Choice & The Return?:** Players decide what to do with the truth and whether/how to return. Their choice dictates the potential return journey – facing Aethelburg forces, sneaking back, or leading a triumphant (but politically charged) return.
    5.  **Aethelburg Reckoning:** If returning, players face the political storm orchestrated by Thorne or his rivals. Presenting findings, potentially facing trials, becoming heroes or scapegoats. The campaign epilogue details the impact on Aethelburg society based on player choices and the revealed truth.

## Key Story Beats (Detailed within Arcs above)

Significant moments include: The Expedition Commissioning Ceremony (meeting Thorne, Veridian, Vance), Surviving the Descent, First Contact with Surface Environment/Life (at locations like the Verdant Maze, Salt Flats, Chronarium Wreckage), Discovery of a Key Ruin/Artifact, Encountering Surface Dwellers (if any), Communication Breakdown/Interference with Aethelburg (potentially orchestrated by Thorne), Resource Crisis & Adaptation (driven by Veridian/Vance), Internal Expedition Conflict/Sabotage (agents of Thorne, Guild rivalries), Uncovering Aethelburg's Hidden History Below, The Major Revelation about the Surface/Aethelburg's Past, The Final Choice regarding the Truth, The Perilous Return Journey (or decision to stay), and the Political Confrontation/Resolution in Aethelburg.

## Player Hooks (Individual Motivations)

*   **The Cartographer's Scion:** Seeking to complete/vindicate the work of an ancestor lost on a rumored previous descent.
*   **The Clockwork Prodigy:** Eager to test experimental Aethelburg exploration gear (designed by Veridian Flux?) in the ultimate field conditions.
*   **The Disgraced Academic:** A historian or scientist seeking forbidden knowledge below to restore their reputation, potentially clashing with Thorne's control of information.
*   **The Sky-Sick Soul:** Feels claustrophobic in Aethelburg, plagued by dreams or an inexplicable pull towards the surface; joins the expedition seeking answers or belonging.
*   **The Guild Prospector:** Sent by a powerful Aethelburg guild (potentially Vance's faction) to locate rare resources rumored below.
*   **The Cog-Baron's Agent:** Secretly tasked by a rival faction to Councilor Thorne to monitor him and the expedition.
*   **The Aeronaut Guard:** Veteran sky-guard assigned for security under Vance, perhaps with hidden loyalties or debts.

## Mysteries & Secrets

*   **The True Reason for Aethelburg's Ascent:** Was it a cataclysm, plague, war, ideological split, scientific necessity (Veridian's suspicion?), or something else?
*   **The Nature of Aethelburg's Power Source:** What keeps the city aloft? Is it stable? Does it have unforeseen costs or requirements linked to the surface?
*   **What *Really* Lies Below?:** Is the surface uniformly like the initial landing zones, or vastly different elsewhere? Are there advanced societies hidden?
*   **The Fate of Those Left Behind:** Did everyone ascend? Are there surface-dwelling human descendants? What are they like?
*   **Accuracy of Aethelburg's Myths:** Which legends hold truth, and which are fabrications (potentially spread by Thorne's faction)?
*   **Internal Sabotage:** Who are Thorne's agents? What are Vance's secret orders or Guild objectives? Does Veridian have hidden motives related to the power source?
*   **Previous Expeditions?:** Were there earlier attempts? What did they find? Why were they covered up (perhaps by Thorne's predecessors)?

## Easter Eggs & Callbacks

*   Finding mundane objects from a past era treated as mystical artifacts by surface dwellers or misinterpreted by Aethelburg scholars.
*   A recurring motif (a gear symbol associated with Thorne's faction, Veridian's maker's mark, Vance's guild sigil) appearing both in Aethelburg and unexpectedly on the surface.
*   Myths about surface monsters turning out to be exaggerated descriptions of creatures in the Verdant Maze or malfunctioning automata in the Chronarium Wreckage.
*   A malfunctioning automaton below speaking in fragmented phrases echoing Councilor Thorne's political slogans.
*   Players finding evidence related to their specific character hooks (e.g., the Cartographer's Scion finding their ancestor's journal near the Chronarium Wreckage).
*   The consequences of early player resource management decisions impacting Veridian's ability to repair equipment or Vance's ability to secure the camp.

## Potential Plot Twists

*   **Beneath is Paradise:** The surface is vibrant and habitable; Thorne's faction lied to maintain control.
*   **Aethelburg is Falling:** Veridian's suspicion is correct; the city's power source is failing, and the expedition is a desperate search for a fix.
*   **We Are the Descendants:** Aethelburg was founded by exiles from a highly advanced surface civilization that *still exists* below (perhaps using tech found in the Chronarium Wreckage).
*   **They Are Watching:** Surface dwellers are aware of Aethelburg and view the expedition (led by figures like Vance) as an invasion.
*   **The Founders' Sin:** Aethelburg's ascent was linked to causing a cataclysm on the surface (perhaps related to the Chronarium Wreckage or the state of the Verdant Maze). Thorne seeks to hide this.
*   **The Cloud Layer Isn't Natural:** It's an artificial barrier (perhaps failing) created by Aethelburg's founders. Veridian might discover this.
*   **Internal Threat:** The real danger isn't the surface, but Vance receiving orders from Thorne to seize control or eliminate the expedition leadership.

## Player Choice Impact

Player decisions significantly shape the narrative and Aethelburg's future:
*   **Exploration Focus:** Prioritizing the Verdant Maze vs. Salt Flats vs. Chronarium Wreckage yields different discoveries and challenges.
*   **Resource Management:** How players use/conserve/adapt limited Aethelburg tech (Veridian's domain) vs. adopting surface methods affects survival and technological development.
*   **First Contact Protocol:** Aggression, diplomacy, or stealth towards surface dwellers dictates future interactions.
*   **Reporting Discoveries:** What information do players relay back (if possible)? Who do they report to (Thorne, Veridian, Vance, their own faction)? This directly influences Aethelburg politics.
*   **Faction Interaction:** Aligning with Thorne (control), Veridian (science), or Vance (security/resources) shapes internal dynamics and potential support/betrayal.
*   **Handling Internal Conflict:** How players deal with dissent, sabotage (Thorne's agents), or leadership challenges (Vance vs. Veridian) affects morale and survival.
*   **The Final Truth:** The players' interpretation and chosen course of action regarding the campaign's central revelation directly determines the epilogue and the future trajectory of Aethelburg.

## Campaign Hooks (Starting Scenarios)

*   **The Aeronaut's Commission:** Players are officially selected members, starting with a briefing from Thorne, gear issue from Veridian's team, and security overview from Vance.
*   **The Stowaway Imperative:** Players sneak aboard Veridian's vessel, needing to integrate with the crew under Vance's watchful eye.
*   **The Ill-Fated Test Flight:** Players are crew on a smaller test vehicle designed by Veridian; a malfunction sends them crashing onto the surface near one of the key locations.
*   **The Sky-Shard Recovery:** A piece of Aethelburg falls; players are a rapid response team under Vance's command, becoming accidental explorers.
*   **The Ghost Signal:** A signal detected from below; players are a small recon team sent to investigate, potentially reporting to Thorne or Veridian.

## Optional Content (Side Quests & Story Threads)

*   **Resource Scouting:** Locating specific materials (resonant crystals from the Salt Flats, unique alloys from the Wreckage) requested by Veridian or Vance's Guild.
*   **Atmospheric Mysteries:** Investigating strange phenomena within the cloud layer during descent/ascent.
*   **Rescue Mission:** Locating survivors/data from a previous secret expedition hinted at by Thorne or found in logs.
*   **Ecological Puzzles:** Understanding the bizarre ecosystem of the Verdant Maze or the energy fields of the Salt Flats.
*   **Surface Dweller Society:** If sentient life exists, undertake quests for them, potentially creating conflict with Vance or Thorne.
*   **Repairing the Vessel:** Gathering rare surface components to help Veridian fix critical damage to the expedition's main transport.
*   **Investigating Sabotage:** Uncovering Thorne's agents within the crew or rival Guild operatives working against Vance.
