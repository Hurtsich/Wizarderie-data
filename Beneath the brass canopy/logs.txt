## Campaign Overview

**Concept:** *Beneath the Brass Canopy* is an RPG campaign centered around the first official expedition in generations from **Aethelburg**, a magnificent steampunk city floating high above the clouds, down to the mysterious, unexplored surface world below. The city's inhabitants subsist on legends and fragmented histories, largely ignorant of the reality beneath them. Players take on the roles of explorers, scientists, engineers, and guards hand-picked (or perhaps self-selected) for this perilous voyage into the unknown.

**Logline:** Tasked with the first descent in centuries, explorers from the magnificent steampunk sky-city of Aethelburg must survive the unknown wonders and horrors of the surface world, returning with truths that could uplift or shatter their suspended society.

**Central Conflict:** The campaign revolves around the tension between **Exploration vs. Survival**, the **Known vs. the Unknown**, the stark contrast between Aethelburg's intricate **Steampunk Technology and the potentially wild, alien, or ruined Surface World**, and the burgeoning **Political Conflict** within Aethelburg as factions vie to control the narrative and resources stemming from the expedition's discoveries.

**Mood:** A blend of **Awe & Wonder** (gazing upon Aethelburg, descending through clouds, initial surface discoveries), **Mystery & Trepidation** (what lies below? why do we float?), **Adventure & Peril** (navigating unknown terrain, facing surface threats), and **Political Intrigue** (reporting findings, dealing with rival agendas within the expedition and back in Aethelburg).

**Primary Themes:**
1.  **Discovery & The Fear of the Unknown:** Charting the uncharted, confronting preconceived notions born from myth, and facing the psychological toll of true isolation and the alien.
2.  **Hubris & Consequences:** Exploring *why* Aethelburg floats. Was it ambition, necessity, or escape? What was the cost? Are the city's foundations (literal or metaphorical) stable?
3.  **Truth & Manipulation:** The power of information. How discoveries are interpreted, reported, potentially censored or weaponized by political factions back in Aethelburg (e.g., Isolationists vs. Expansionists vs. Resource Exploiters).
4.  **Nature vs. Machine:** The juxtaposition of Aethelburg's complex clockwork, steam, and brass technology against the potentially untamed, overgrown, mutated, or magically infused environment of the surface. Which is truly more resilient?
5.  **Adaptation & Survival:** Players must adapt Aethelburg methods and tech to survive the surface, possibly learning new ways from the environment or its inhabitants (if any).

## Campaign Structure

The campaign follows a three-arc structure, charting the expedition's journey from launch to potential return and its consequences.

**Arc 1: The Grand Descent (Levels ~1-5)**
*   **Focus:** Introduction to Aethelburg society and technology, the expedition's launch, the perilous journey downwards, establishing a foothold on the surface, initial exploration, and survival challenges.
*   **Key Beats:**
    1.  **The Commissioning/Embarkation:** Players are introduced, receive their mission briefing from Aethelburg authorities (e.g., Councilor Aris Thorne, the Exploration Cog-Guild), and board the expedition's primary vessel (designed by Chief Artificer Veridian Flux). Fanfare and political maneuvering in Aethelburg are visible.
    2.  **Breaching the Canopy:** The harrowing descent through the perpetual cloud layer – potentially featuring turbulence, strange atmospheric phenomena, navigational hazards, or encounters with bizarre cloud-dwelling creatures hinted at in legends. Testing the limits of Aethelburg tech.
    3.  **First Landing:** Setting down on the surface (perhaps near The Verdant Maze, The Whispering Salt Flats, or The Chronarium Wreckage). The initial moments of sensory input – alien smells, strange gravity(?), bizarre flora, unsettling silence or overwhelming noise. Establishing a secure base camp under Guild-Captain Vance's supervision.
    4.  **Initial Reconnaissance:** Short-range patrols, cataloging immediate environment, facing first surface dangers (predatory wildlife, treacherous terrain, hazardous atmospheric pockets). Discovering the basics of survival in this new world.
    5.  **The First Anomaly:** Finding something unexpected that doesn't fit Aethelburg's myths – a strangely preserved ruin within the Verdant Maze, the source of the hum in the Salt Flats, a functioning component in the Chronarium Wreckage. This discovery raises the stakes and attracts attention (potentially internal conflict between Thorne's agents, Veridian's curiosity, and Vance's objectives).

**Arc 2: Echoes from Below (Levels ~6-10)**
*   **Focus:** Deeper exploration into the surface world, uncovering significant landmarks or civilizations (lost or active), finding clues relating to Aethelburg's past and reason for ascent, managing dwindling resources, and dealing with internal expedition conflicts or external interference from Aethelburg.
*   **Key Beats:**
    1.  **Mapping the Unknown:** Venturing further, potentially discovering other key locations. Logistical challenges mount.
    2.  **Whispers of the Past:** Finding substantial evidence related to why Aethelburg ascended – perhaps data cores in the Chronarium Wreckage, preserved murals in the Verdant Maze, or resonant echoes in the Salt Flats hinting at a cataclysm.
    3.  **Contact?:** Encountering sentient surface dwellers (if they exist). First contact protocols tested, potentially influenced by Thorne's caution, Veridian's eagerness, or Vance's suspicion.
    4.  **Supply Chain Pressure:** Resources from Aethelburg dwindle or are cut off (accidentally or deliberately by Thorne's faction?). The expedition must become more self-sufficient, relying on surface resources (Veridian adapts tech, Vance secures resources). Internal tensions rise.
    5.  **Interference from Above:** Receiving conflicting orders from Thorne vs. other Council factions. Perhaps a rival Guild vessel arrives, challenging Vance's authority or Veridian's findings. Sabotage from Thorne's agents becomes a real threat.

**Arc 3: The Surface Truth & The Sky-Bound Reckoning (Levels ~11+)**
*   **Focus:** Uncovering the central truth about the surface world and Aethelburg's relationship to it. Making a critical decision about this truth's dissemination. The potential return journey and confronting the political fallout in Aethelburg, or choosing a different path.
*   **Key Beats:**
    1.  **The Core Revelation:** Discovering the fundamental truth (e.g., Aethelburg's power source requires surface components found only in hazardous zones, the city founders caused the surface state, the surface holds a cure for Aethelburg's 'Sky-Lung' disease).
    2.  **Point of No Return:** A major event forces a decision – Veridian's vessel critically damaged, Vance receives orders to silence the expedition, discovery of a truth Thorne cannot allow back.
    3.  **Faction Endgame on the Surface:** Rival factions within the expedition (Thorne loyalists, Veridian's science-first group, Vance's security/Guild faction, player-led group) clash over the discovered truth and future actions.
    4.  **The Choice & The Return?:** Players decide what to do with the truth and whether/how to return. Their choice dictates the potential return journey – facing Aethelburg forces, sneaking back, or leading a triumphant (but politically charged) return.
    5.  **Aethelburg Reckoning:** If returning, players face the political storm orchestrated by Thorne or his rivals. Presenting findings, potentially facing trials, becoming heroes or scapegoats. The campaign epilogue details the impact on Aethelburg society based on player choices and the revealed truth.

## Key Story Beats (Detailed within Arcs above)

Significant moments include: The Expedition Commissioning Ceremony (meeting Thorne, Veridian, Vance), Surviving the Descent, First Contact with Surface Environment/Life (at locations like the Verdant Maze, Salt Flats, Chronarium Wreckage), Discovery of a Key Ruin/Artifact, Encountering Surface Dwellers (if any), Communication Breakdown/Interference with Aethelburg (potentially orchestrated by Thorne), Resource Crisis & Adaptation (driven by Veridian/Vance), Internal Expedition Conflict/Sabotage (agents of Thorne, Guild rivalries), Uncovering Aethelburg's Hidden History Below, The Major Revelation about the Surface/Aethelburg's Past, The Final Choice regarding the Truth, The Perilous Return Journey (or decision to stay), and the Political Confrontation/Resolution in Aethelburg.

## Player Hooks (Individual Motivations)

*   **The Cartographer's Scion:** Seeking to complete/vindicate the work of an ancestor lost on a rumored previous descent.
*   **The Clockwork Prodigy:** Eager to test experimental Aethelburg exploration gear (designed by Veridian Flux?) in the ultimate field conditions.
*   **The Disgraced Academic:** A historian or scientist seeking forbidden knowledge below to restore their reputation, potentially clashing with Thorne's control of information.
*   **The Sky-Sick Soul:** Feels claustrophobic in Aethelburg, plagued by dreams or an inexplicable pull towards the surface; joins the expedition seeking answers or belonging.
*   **The Guild Prospector:** Sent by a powerful Aethelburg guild (potentially Vance's faction) to locate rare resources rumored below.
*   **The Cog-Baron's Agent:** Secretly tasked by a rival faction to Councilor Thorne to monitor him and the expedition.
*   **The Aeronaut Guard:** Veteran sky-guard assigned for security under Vance, perhaps with hidden loyalties or debts.

## Mysteries & Secrets

*   **The True Reason for Aethelburg's Ascent:** Was it a cataclysm, plague, war, ideological split, scientific necessity (Veridian's suspicion?), or something else?
*   **The Nature of Aethelburg's Power Source:** What keeps the city aloft? Is it stable? Does it have unforeseen costs or requirements linked to the surface?
*   **What *Really* Lies Below?:** Is the surface uniformly like the initial landing zones, or vastly different elsewhere? Are there advanced societies hidden?
*   **The Fate of Those Left Behind:** Did everyone ascend? Are there surface-dwelling human descendants? What are they like?
*   **Accuracy of Aethelburg's Myths:** Which legends hold truth, and which are fabrications (potentially spread by Thorne's faction)?
*   **Internal Sabotage:** Who are Thorne's agents? What are Vance's secret orders or Guild objectives? Does Veridian have hidden motives related to the power source?
*   **Previous Expeditions?:** Were there earlier attempts? What did they find? Why were they covered up (perhaps by Thorne's predecessors)?

## Easter Eggs & Callbacks

*   Finding mundane objects from a past era treated as mystical artifacts by surface dwellers or misinterpreted by Aethelburg scholars.
*   A recurring motif (a gear symbol associated with Thorne's faction, Veridian's maker's mark, Vance's guild sigil) appearing both in Aethelburg and unexpectedly on the surface.
*   Myths about surface monsters turning out to be exaggerated descriptions of creatures in the Verdant Maze or malfunctioning automata in the Chronarium Wreckage.
*   A malfunctioning automaton below speaking in fragmented phrases echoing Councilor Thorne's political slogans.
*   Players finding evidence related to their specific character hooks (e.g., the Cartographer's Scion finding their ancestor's journal near the Chronarium Wreckage).
*   The consequences of early player resource management decisions impacting Veridian's ability to repair equipment or Vance's ability to secure the camp.

## Potential Plot Twists

*   **Beneath is Paradise:** The surface is vibrant and habitable; Thorne's faction lied to maintain control.
*   **Aethelburg is Falling:** Veridian's suspicion is correct; the city's power source is failing, and the expedition is a desperate search for a fix.
*   **We Are the Descendants:** Aethelburg was founded by exiles from a highly advanced surface civilization that *still exists* below (perhaps using tech found in the Chronarium Wreckage).
*   **They Are Watching:** Surface dwellers are aware of Aethelburg and view the expedition (led by figures like Vance) as an invasion.
*   **The Founders' Sin:** Aethelburg's ascent was linked to causing a cataclysm on the surface (perhaps related to the Chronarium Wreckage or the state of the Verdant Maze). Thorne seeks to hide this.
*   **The Cloud Layer Isn't Natural:** It's an artificial barrier (perhaps failing) created by Aethelburg's founders. Veridian might discover this.
*   **Internal Threat:** The real danger isn't the surface, but Vance receiving orders from Thorne to seize control or eliminate the expedition leadership.

## Player Choice Impact

Player decisions significantly shape the narrative and Aethelburg's future:
*   **Exploration Focus:** Prioritizing the Verdant Maze vs. Salt Flats vs. Chronarium Wreckage yields different discoveries and challenges.
*   **Resource Management:** How players use/conserve/adapt limited Aethelburg tech (Veridian's domain) vs. adopting surface methods affects survival and technological development.
*   **First Contact Protocol:** Aggression, diplomacy, or stealth towards surface dwellers dictates future interactions.
*   **Reporting Discoveries:** What information do players relay back (if possible)? Who do they report to (Thorne, Veridian, Vance, their own faction)? This directly influences Aethelburg politics.
*   **Faction Interaction:** Aligning with Thorne (control), Veridian (science), or Vance (security/resources) shapes internal dynamics and potential support/betrayal.
*   **Handling Internal Conflict:** How players deal with dissent, sabotage (Thorne's agents), or leadership challenges (Vance vs. Veridian) affects morale and survival.
*   **The Final Truth:** The players' interpretation and chosen course of action regarding the campaign's central revelation directly determines the epilogue and the future trajectory of Aethelburg.

## Campaign Hooks (Starting Scenarios)

*   **The Aeronaut's Commission:** Players are officially selected members, starting with a briefing from Thorne, gear issue from Veridian's team, and security overview from Vance.
*   **The Stowaway Imperative:** Players sneak aboard Veridian's vessel, needing to integrate with the crew under Vance's watchful eye.
*   **The Ill-Fated Test Flight:** Players are crew on a smaller test vehicle designed by Veridian; a malfunction sends them crashing onto the surface near one of the key locations.
*   **The Sky-Shard Recovery:** A piece of Aethelburg falls; players are a rapid response team under Vance's command, becoming accidental explorers.
*   **The Ghost Signal:** A signal detected from below; players are a small recon team sent to investigate, potentially reporting to Thorne or Veridian.

## Optional Content (Side Quests & Story Threads)

*   **Detailed Regional Mapping:** Charting the Verdant Maze, Whispering Salt Flats, or Chronarium Wreckage.
*   **Flora & Fauna Compendium:** Cataloging life in the Verdant Maze for Veridian or Aethelburg guilds.

## The Ascent of Aethelburg: A History Forged in Steam and Shadow

The world below is a tapestry woven from whispers, myths, and fragmented data-slates – a place spoken of in hushed tones in the gas-lit taverns of Aethelburg or debated in sanitized theories within the halls of the Athenaeum Mechanica. For the citizens of the magnificent floating metropolis, the surface, the 'Down Below,' is less a place and more a concept, a historical footnote to their own miraculous existence among the clouds. The truth, as always, is far more complex and dangerous.

Centuries ago, the world was not suspended. Cities sprawled across continents, powered by burgeoning technologies that blended intricate clockwork with potent, volatile energy sources derived from deep terrestrial veins – a precursor to Aethelburg's own Aetherium science. This era, often romanticized as the 'Age of Titans' due to the colossal constructs and ambitious projects undertaken, was marked by fierce rivalries between city-states and burgeoning empires. Innovation bred hubris, and the relentless exploitation of the planet's resources led to increasing instability.

The catalyst for the end wasn't a single war or discovery, but a convergence of ecological collapse and technological catastrophe known as **The Sundering**. Accounts vary wildly: some speak of world-spanning toxic Blight storms unleashed by resource wars, others of runaway geological reactions triggered by deep-core energy extraction, and still others whisper of reality itself fraying under the strain of reckless chrono-spatial experiments. Whatever the precise sequence, the surface world became increasingly hostile. Skies choked with caustic miasma, lands twisted by uncontrolled energies, and monstrous flora and fauna mutated by the poisoned environment became terrifyingly common. Civilisation fractured.

Amidst this chaos, a coalition of brilliant, perhaps ruthless, visionaries – scientists, engineers, philosophers, and industrialists known collectively as the Founders – conceived of a radical solution: escape. Not to the stars, but upwards, above the Blight, the miasma, and the terrestrial horrors. Their chosen location was the region then known as Silvermire, a hub of technological innovation and Aetheric research. Led by figures now lost to precise history but venerated in vague terms (like the mythical 'Great Architect'), they repurposed existing infrastructure and poured resources into constructing **Aethelburg**.

The heart of their ambition was the **Aetherium Core**, a colossal engine harnessing geo-resonant energies, stabilized and amplified through intricate clockwork mechanisms and esoteric field science. Its power source remains Aethelburg's most guarded secret, but it allowed the city, built upon massive interlocking platforms and structural spars, to defy gravity.

**The Ascent** itself was not a gentle lift-off but a chaotic, desperate exodus. Not everyone could be saved. Choices were made – brutal, pragmatic choices – about who would board the rising city and who would be left behind. Records of this period are heavily curated or simply lost, replaced by heroic narratives of the Founders' wisdom and the city's salvation. The journey upwards through the turbulent, Blight-choked lower atmosphere was perilous, scarring the lower decks of the city and fostering a deep-seated cultural fear of the lethal 'Canopy' – the perpetual, toxic cloud layer below Aethelburg.

Once safely above the worst of the surface chaos, Aethelburg entered the **Silent Century**. Contact with the surface ceased entirely. Survival demanded inward focus: refining the Core's stability, establishing governance (the precursor to the current Council), developing hydroponics and atmospheric condensers, and building the intricate society of guilds, districts, and clockwork marvels seen today. Knowledge of the Down Below faded into myth. The Sundering became a cautionary tale about hubris (ironically), the surface a cursed realm, and Aethelburg a sanctuary, a testament to ingenuity and survival.

Now, generations later, the city thrives, a beacon of brass and steam against the endless blue. Yet, resources are finite, the Core's long-term stability is debated in hushed tones by artificers like Veridian Flux, and political factions like Councilor Thorne's Stabilizers clash with those pushing for new frontiers, like Guild-Captain Vance's resource-hungry Cog & Compass Guild. The pressure builds. Old myths are being questioned. The time has come to look down, to breach the Canopy, and discover what truly lies beneath.

## Landmarks of the Sky and Surface

**Aethelburg Locations:**

1.  **The Grand Cogworks (District Mechanica):** The industrial heart of Aethelburg. A labyrinth of factories, foundries, steam conduits, and gear-driven machinery stretching across several lower and mid-level platforms. The air hums with rhythmic clanging and hisses with escaping steam. Home to the Artificer's Guild headquarters and countless workshops. *Significance:* Center of production, technological innovation (Veridian Flux's power base), and labor. Prone to industrial accidents and worker unrest (potential connection to the Undercity Network).
2.  **Skyport Imperia:** The main docking and launch facility, situated on Aethelburg's uppermost, outward-facing platforms. Huge gantries, mooring towers for dirigibles, customs houses, and warehouses bustle with activity. This is where the expedition vessel launches. *Significance:* Hub of trade (what little exists between city levels), travel, and security (Guild-Captain Vance often oversees operations here). A place of arrivals, departures, and potential sabotage.
3.  **The Gilded Spire (Council Apex):** The seat of Aethelburg's governance, located atop the centralmost spire. Houses the Council Chambers, residences for high-ranking officials like Councilor Thorne, opulent halls, and secure archives (containing potentially sanitized histories). *Significance:* Center of political power, intrigue, and decision-making. Access is heavily restricted. Thorne holds considerable influence here.
4.  **The Undercity Labyrinth (The Rivets):** The sprawling, dimly lit lower decks and maintenance shafts of Aethelburg. A maze of pipes, catwalks, cramped living quarters, hidden markets, and waste reclamation units. Home to the city's working class, engineers performing essential maintenance, and less savory elements. *Significance:* Represents the forgotten foundation of the city, rife with social tension, secrets, and the Undercity Network's operations. Players might have contacts or enemies here.
5.  **The Athenaeum Mechanica:** A grand repository of knowledge, filled with data-slates, schematics, historical texts (often edited), and scientific instruments. Dominated by towering brass orreries and humming analytical engines. Chief Artificer Veridian Flux spends much of her time here. *Significance:* Center of learning and research. Holds clues about Aethelburg's technology, censored history, and perhaps forgotten details about the surface or previous expeditions.

**Surface Locations:**

6.  **The Verdant Maze (Remnants of the Silvermire Citadel):** *(Expanded)* Once a sprawling urban and technological center (likely near Aethelburg's origin point), now consumed by hyper-aggressive, mutated flora. Twisted metal spars and ferrocrete structures jut from seas of strangling vines, toxic fungi, and colossal predatory plants. Symbiotic machines, remnants of the Citadel's automation, still patrol erratically, sometimes entangled with or even 'piloted' by plant growths. *Geography:* Dense, multi-level jungle ruin. *Inhabitants:* Mutated flora, predatory fauna, malfunctioning automata, potential primitive human tribes adapted to the Green. *Significance:* Direct link to Aethelburg's origins, potential source of pre-Ascent tech, extreme environmental hazard. Holds clues about the Sundering's ecological impact.
7.  **The Whispering Salt Flats & Crystal Spires:** *(Expanded)* An immense, blindingly white salt flat stretching to the horizon, punctuated by towering crystalline structures that resonate with atmospheric energy, creating eerie sonic phenomena (the 'whispers'). Sub-surface, accessible via fissures or collapsed areas, lie ancient brine tunnels and perhaps preserved pre-Sundering structures. The crystals hum with power, potentially related to the Aetherium Core's principles. *Geography:* Vast, arid flatland, colossal crystal formations, subterranean tunnels. *Inhabitants:* Crystalline predators adapted to sonic hunting, extremophile organisms, perhaps nomadic scavengers. *Significance:* Alien landscape, potential energy source, location of unique resources, navigational hazard due to disorientation and sonic effects. Holds clues about unusual energy phenomena and potentially non-standard life.
8.  **The Chronarium Wreckage (The Fallen Cog):** *(Expanded)* The catastrophic impact site of what appears to be a colossal, clockwork/Aetheric device – perhaps a weapon, a terraforming engine, or even a failed precursor to Aethelburg. Time behaves erratically within its debris field; pockets of slow-motion, rapid aging, or temporal loops flicker in and out of existence. Automated defenses may still function sporadically. *Geography:* Shattered machine landscape, unstable ground, localized temporal distortions. *Inhabitants:* Malfunctioning automata, temporal echoes/ghosts, creatures warped by time fluxes. *Significance:* Source of extreme danger and bizarre discoveries, hints at the advanced (and potentially reckless) technology of the pre-Sundering era, potential source of temporal paradoxes or unique technological salvage.
9.  **The Ashen Scar:** A vast, desolate region perpetually covered in fine grey-black ash. Twisted, blackened trees stand like skeletal fingers against a bruised sky. The air tastes metallic, and strange energies linger. This appears to be ground zero for a major Sundering event – perhaps a weapon impact or a massive industrial meltdown. *Geography:* Ash dunes, petrified forests, irradiated zones, toxic air pockets. *Inhabitants:* Ash Golems (elemental/constructs?), radiation-resistant scavengers, desperate survivors eking out a miserable existence. *Significance:* Direct evidence of the Sundering's destructive power, hazardous environment, source of unique geological/energy readings, potential location of buried pre-Ascent military tech or facilities.
10. **The Sunken Archives:** The flooded ruins of what was clearly a major repository of knowledge – a library, university, or data center – now submerged beneath a vast, eerily clear lake or inland sea created by post-Sundering geographical shifts. Water-tight vaults or magically sealed chambers might still protect invaluable records. *Geography:* Underwater ruins, submerged structures, potentially dangerous aquatic life adapted to the flooded environment. *Inhabitants:* Mutated aquatic life, amphibious scavengers, possibly automated archival guardians still functioning. *Significance:* Potential trove of uncensored history, scientific knowledge, or maps of the old world, extremely difficult to access, requires specialized equipment or adaptation.

## Factions of Aethelburg

    *   **History:** Formed from the amalgamation of various merchant guilds, security forces, and transport syndicates. Gained power by controlling the flow of goods, information, and personnel within Aethelburg. Pragmatic and profit-driven.
    *   **Power Structure:** A powerful conglomerate with significant control over Skyport Imperia, warehousing, internal security forces (outside the formal City Guard), and exploration charters. Operates through contracts, logistical control, and force projection. Internally divided between cautious resource managers and aggressive expansionists.
    *   **Key Figure:** **Guild-Captain Kaelen Vance.** Stern, pragmatic, fiercely loyal to the Guild and the mission's success (as defined by tangible returns). Responsible for expedition security and resource management. Suspicious of both Thorne's political games and Veridian's unchecked ambition.
    *   **Campaign Involvement:** Provides the expedition's security detail and logistical framework. Focused on mission parameters, resource acquisition, and risk assessment. May clash with players over methods, resource allocation, or perceived threats to the mission's tangible success. Represents pragmatism, security, and potential exploitation.
4.  **The Sky-Bound Traditionalists (Keepers of the Ascent):**
    *   **Goals:** Uphold the belief that Aethelburg's ascent was a sacred or destined event. View the surface as cursed, fallen, or fundamentally dangerous to the soul of Aethelburg. Resist any attempts to return or engage significantly with the Down Below.
    *   **History:** Evolved from philosophical and religious groups that formed during the Silent Century, interpreting the Ascent through a lens of divine providence or necessary separation from a corrupted world.
    *   **Power Structure:** Influence is primarily cultural and ideological, strong among certain segments of the population and holding some sway in ceremonial functions. Operates through sermons, pamphlets, public appeals, and appeals to tradition/fear.
    *   **Key Figures:** High Speaker Eloise (charismatic orator), Keeper Malachi (historian focused on proving the surface's cursed nature).
    *   **Campaign Involvement:** Act as societal opposition to the expedition. May attempt to sway public opinion against the players or interpret any disasters as proof of their folly. Could possess fragmented, mythologized truths about the Ascent or the surface passed down through oral tradition.
5.  **The Undercity Network (The Whispers):**
    *   **Goals:** Improve conditions for the workers in the lower decks. Gain leverage against the upper-class factions. Traffic in secrets, contraband, and unregulated services. Survive and carve out autonomy in the shadows of the Gilded Spire and Grand Cogworks.
    *   **History:** A loose, decentralized network that evolved organically from worker solidarity, black markets, and resistance to Guild/Council oversight in the Undercity Labyrinth. Operates out of necessity and shared distrust of the elite.
    *   **Power Structure:** No formal hierarchy. Relies on trust, reputation, hidden communication channels, and mutual benefit. Key nodes exist in specific taverns, workshops, or maintenance hubs.
    *   **Key Figures:** Numerous local leaders and information brokers (e.g., 'Ratchet' Finn, Anya 'the Spark'). No single leader.
    *   **Campaign Involvement:** Potential source of information, illicit gear, or unexpected aid for the players, particularly if they are sympathetic or need to operate outside official channels. Could also be antagonists if the expedition threatens their operations or if bribed by other factions. May possess unique knowledge about Aethelburg's flaws or hidden passages.

## Defining Historical Events

1.  **The Sundering (Approx. 400-500 years ago):** The period of cascading catastrophes (ecological, technological, possibly warfare-related) that rendered much of the surface world hostile and led to the collapse of the pre-Ascent civilizations. Its exact nature is obscured by time and deliberate obfuscation, forming a core mystery.
2.  **The Great Architect's Vision (Approx. 350-400 years ago):** The period encompassing the conceptualization, design, and initial construction of Aethelburg and its Aetherium Core within the Silvermire region, driven by the Founders amidst the chaos of the Sundering. Represents a monumental feat of engineering and ambition.
3.  **The Ascent (Approx. 300 years ago):** The specific, chaotic event when Aethelburg lifted off from the surface, separating from the world below and carrying a select population upwards. Marked by difficult choices, likely betrayal, and the severing of ties with those left behind. The official narrative emphasizes heroism; the reality was likely far messier.
4.  **The Silent Century (Approx. 300-200 years ago):** The first hundred years after the Ascent. A period of isolation, consolidation, technological refinement (stabilizing the Core, developing life support), formation of Aethelburg's core institutions (Council, Guilds), and the deliberate or accidental loss/suppression of detailed knowledge about the surface. Myths replaced history.
5.  **The Cogwork Riots (Approx. 70 years ago):** A period of significant civil unrest centered in the Grand Cogworks and Undercity Labyrinth. Sparked by resource shortages, dangerous working conditions, and perceived inequities enforced by the Guilds and Council. Brutally suppressed, but led to minor reforms and cemented distrust between the lower decks and the elites. Served as a catalyst for the Undercity Network's quiet growth.

## Secrets and Legends

*   **The True Nature of the Aetherium Core:** It's more than just steam and gears. Legends whisper it's powered by a captured elemental, a shard of a fallen star, the collective psychic resonance of the city, or even something siphoned from the supposedly dead surface world itself. Veridian Flux is obsessed with discovering this truth. Its potential instability or dependence on unknown factors is a critical secret.
*   **The Founders' Pact:** Whispers suggest the Founders made dark bargains or terrible compromises to achieve the Ascent – deals with unknown entities, sacrifices of certain populations left behind, or the use of forbidden technologies whose consequences are still felt. Evidence might lie hidden in secure Council archives or deep within the Chronarium Wreckage.
*   **Echoes of Descent:** Despite official histories claiming this is the *first* expedition, persistent rumors and fragmented data suggest previous attempts were made, perhaps during the Silent Century or even more recently. What happened to them? Were they lost, destroyed, or did they find something so terrifying that their records were erased by factions like the Stabilizers? Anomalous signals or wreckage found on the surface could point to these lost voyages.
*   **The Surface Bloom Prophecy:** A fragmented, often dismissed prophecy found in obscure texts within the Athenaeum. It speaks not of a dead world, but a dormant one, destined to "bloom" or "reawaken," revealing either paradise or a new form of horror. Some Traditionalists fear it, while some Prometheans see it as a sign of untapped potential. Its true meaning is a central mystery.
*   **The Silent Watchers:** A persistent myth among sky-sailors and Undercity dwellers. They speak of fleeting shapes glimpsed in the cloud layer below Aethelburg or strange energy signatures detected from the surface – not random phenomena, but suggesting something intelligent is observing the floating city. Are they survivors, alien life, or automated remnants of the past? Their existence, if proven, would shatter Aethelburg's sense of isolation.
*   **Thorne's Hidden Agenda:** Councilor Thorne's motivations may go beyond simple stability. Perhaps his family lineage has a dark secret tied to the Ascent, or he knows something specific about the surface (or the Core) that he desperately needs to remain hidden. His suppression of truth might be deeply personal.
*   **Veridian's Secret Project:** Chief Artificer Flux may be pursuing research far beyond her official mandate, possibly attempting to replicate dangerous pre-Sundering technologies or even communicate with whatever powers the Aetherium Core, risking the entire city's safety for knowledge.
*   **Vance's Contingency:** Guild-Captain Vance, ever the pragmatist, likely has secret orders or contingency plans from the Cog & Compass Guild regarding resource exploitation or dealing with unforeseen threats/discoveries, potentially putting her at odds with the official mission parameters or the players' choices."

## I. Core Mechanic: The Cog & Dice System

This system uses **six-sided dice (d6)**. When a character attempts an action where the outcome is uncertain and carries risk or consequence, they make a **Check**.

1.  **Determine Dice Pool:** The Game Master (GM) determines the relevant **Attribute** and **Skill** for the action. The base dice pool is **Attribute Rating + Skill Rating**.
    *   Situational modifiers (advantageous tools, favourable circumstances) might add 1-2 dice.
    *   Situational penalties (damaged gear, hazardous environment, hindering conditions) might remove 1-2 dice (to a minimum of 1 die).
2.  **Roll Dice:** Roll the dice in the pool.
3.  **Count Successes:** Each die showing a **4, 5, or 6** is a **Success**.
4.  **Determine Outcome:**
    *   **0 Successes:** **Failure.** The action fails, potentially with a complication or negative consequence (GM narrates).
    *   **1 Success:** **Partial Success / Success at Cost.** The character achieves their basic goal but might face a minor consequence, take longer, use more resources, or expose themselves to danger (Player choice or GM decision).
    *   **2 Successes:** **Full Success.** The character achieves their goal effectively and without significant issue.
    *   **3+ Successes:** **Critical Success.** The character achieves their goal exceptionally well, gaining an added benefit, completing the task faster, creating an advantage, or achieving a more significant outcome (GM narrates).
5.  **Critical Effects:**
    *   **Complication (Optional Rule):** If a Check results in 0 Successes *and* one or more '1's are rolled, the GM introduces a significant complication or setback related to the failed action (e.g., tool breaks, loud noise attracts attention, social blunder worsens situation).
    *   **Pushing Your Luck:** Before rolling, a player can choose to 'Push'. They gain +1 die to their pool, but any '1' rolled on the check cancels out one Success. This represents taking risks for greater reward.

## II. Character Creation

1.  **Concept:** Define your character's core idea (e.g., Gear-obsessed Engineer, By-the-book Aeronaut Guard, Curious Cartographer's Scion).
2.  **Attributes:** Characters have four Attributes, representing core capabilities. Distribute 8 points among them (minimum 1, maximum 4 in any Attribute at creation).
    *   **Grit:** Physical resilience, endurance, resisting harm, close combat prowess.
    *   **Cogs:** Intelligence, reasoning, technical knowledge, perception, scientific understanding.
    *   **Finesse:** Agility, precision, stealth, ranged attacks, delicate manipulation.
    *   **Bearing:** Presence, social influence, leadership, willpower, deception.
3.  **Skills:** Skills represent specific training or aptitude. Each Attribute governs related Skills. You start with **10 points** to distribute among Skills. No Skill can start higher than **3**. A Skill cannot be higher than its governing Attribute. Starting with a Skill at 0 means you are untrained (roll only Attribute dice).
    *   **Grit Skills:** Athletics (Climbing, Jumping), Endurance (Resisting fatigue/hazards), Melee (Close combat), Survival (Foraging, Shelter, Tracking).
    *   **Cogs Skills:** Engineering (Repair, Build, Understand tech), Investigation (Gather clues, Analyze data), Lore (History, Factions, Legends), Science (Analyze phenomena, Biology, Chemistry).
    *   **Finesse Skills:** Marksmanship (Ranged attacks), Piloting (Handling vehicles/automatons), Stealth (Moving unseen, Hiding), Tinkering (Delicate repairs, Lockpicking, Gadgeteering).
    *   **Bearing Skills:** Command (Leading others, Giving orders), Deceive (Lying, Misdirection), Persuade (Negotiation, Diplomacy), Intimidate (Coercion, Threats).
4.  **Origin:** Choose an Origin reflecting their Aethelburg background (e.g., Cartographer's Scion, Clockwork Prodigy, Disgraced Academic, Sky-Sick Soul, Guild Prospector, Cog-Baron's Agent, Aeronaut Guard, Undercity Fixer).
    *   *Benefit:* Grants +1 to a specific Skill (potentially exceeding the starting cap of 3, but not the Attribute cap) OR a unique narrative Hook/Contact related to their background.
5.  **Role:** Choose an Expedition Role (e.g., Scientist, Engineer, Guard, Scout, Medic, Quartermaster).
    *   *Benefit:* Grants a starting 'Aethelburg Tech Package' relevant to the role (see Section VI - this is essential starting equipment) and proficiency (+1 die when using) with one specific type of related equipment (e.g., Scientist: Analytical Kit; Guard: Standard Issue Steam Rifle). Characters also receive basic adventuring gear (clothing, rations, basic tools).
6.  **Derived Stats:**
    *   **Health:** Grit x 3. Represents physical resilience. Damage reduces Health. Reaching 0 Health means incapacitated.
    *   **Composure:** Bearing x 3. Represents mental fortitude. Fear, stress, and certain phenomena reduce Composure. Reaching 0 Composure means panicked, catatonic, or otherwise mentally overwhelmed.
    *   **Defense:** Base 1 + Finesse / 2 (round down). Represents base ability to avoid hits. Armor adds to this.
    *   **Resourcefulness:** Cogs / 2 (round down). Represents starting bonus 'Parts' or 'Supplies' (see Section VI).
7.  **Finishing Touches:** Name, appearance, personality, a personal goal, and a secret or connection to one of the campaign's mysteries or factions.

## III. Skill System & Action Economy

*   **Using Skills:** When the outcome is uncertain, make a Check using Attribute + Skill.
    *   **Exploration:** Survival (Tracking, Foraging), Piloting (Navigating terrain with vehicles), Lore (Identifying landmarks from myths), Investigation (Mapping terrain features).
    *   **Interaction:** Persuade, Deceive, Intimidate, Command (Used in social encounters, political maneuvering within the expedition). Bearing is the key Attribute.
    *   **Technical:** Engineering (Repairing gear, building shelter reinforcements), Tinkering (Modifying gadgets, disabling traps), Science (Analyzing samples, understanding anomalies). Cogs is the key Attribute.
    *   **Survival:** Endurance (Resisting hazards), Survival (Finding food/water, building shelter), Science (Identifying safe flora/fauna). Grit and Cogs are key.
    *   **Investigation:** Investigation (Finding clues, analyzing scenes), Lore (Connecting findings to Aethelburg history/legends), Science (Understanding mechanism of ruins/anomalies). Cogs is key.
*   **Action Economy (Out of Combat):** Time is more fluid. Actions take narrative time. Complex tasks (repairing complex machinery, detailed research) might require multiple Checks or represent 'Downtime' activities.
*   **Action Economy (In Combat / Structured Time):**
    *   Turns are taken in rounds. Determine initiative at the start of combat with a **Finesse Check**; highest result goes first, proceeding downwards. Ties are broken by Finesse Attribute, then player choice.
    *   On your turn, you can take:
        *   **One Major Action:** Attack, Use a complex Skill/Technological Device, Attempt a maneuver (e.g., Disarm, Shove), Stabilize a fallen comrade (requires Medic kit and Cogs+Science check).
        *   **One Minor Action:** Move up to your Speed (approx. 10 meters), Aim (+1 die to next attack), Draw/Stow weapon/item, Interact simply (open door, speak briefly), Take Cover (+1 Defense).
        *   **One Reaction (Outside your turn):** Perform an Opportunity Attack (if foe leaves melee), attempt to Dodge (make a Finesse Check vs Attack result - if successes equal or exceed attack successes, negate the hit), use a specific defensive tech ability.

## IV. Combat System

1.  **Turn Structure:** Initiative determines order (see Action Economy). Each participant takes a turn each round.
2.  **Actions in Combat:** Use the Action Economy described above (Major, Minor, Reaction).
3.  **Making Attacks:**
    *   **Melee:** Grit + Melee Check vs. Target's Defense.
    *   **Ranged:** Finesse + Marksmanship Check vs. Target's Defense.
    *   *Success:* On a Full Success (2+ successes), the attack hits and deals damage. A Partial Success (1 success) might mean hitting but dealing less damage, hitting armor only, or hitting but exposing yourself to a counter-attack (GM choice based on context).
4.  **Damage & Defense:**
    *   **Damage:** Weapons have a base Damage rating (e.g., Steam Rifle: 4 damage). Add +1 damage for each success beyond the first on the attack Check.
    *   **Damage Types:**
        *   *Physical:* Standard impact, cuts, etc.
        *   *Piercing:* Ignores 1-2 points of Armor (specified by weapon/attack).
        *   *Steam/Heat:* Burns, potential 'Overheated' condition.
        *   *Toxin/Acid:* Damage over time, potential 'Poisoned' condition.
        *   *Energy:* From surface phenomena or strange tech, effects vary.
        *   *Stress:* Affects Composure instead of Health.
    *   **Armor:** Provides an Armor Value (AV). Reduce incoming Physical/Piercing damage by AV. Heavy armor might impose a Finesse penalty. Armor can be damaged or ablated by specific attacks or critical failures.
    *   **Taking Damage:** Subtract final damage from Health. If reduced to 0 Health, character is incapacitated (dying, unconscious - GM determines specifics). Requires stabilization (Major Action, Medic kit, Cogs+Science check) to prevent death.
5.  **Special Effects & Conditions:**
    *   **Critical Hit (3+ Successes on Attack):** Maximize weapon damage OR add a relevant Condition OR bypass some Armor.
    *   **Critical Failure (0 Successes + Complication):** Weapon jams/breaks, hit an ally, expose self to counter-attack.
    *   **Conditions (Examples):** Impose penalties (-1/-2 dice to relevant checks), limit actions, or cause ongoing damage/stress.
        *   *Overheated:* (From steam tech/heat) -1 Finesse die, possible minor Heat damage each turn until cooled.
        *   *Entangled:* (Vines, nets) Cannot Move, Finesse Checks disadvantaged. Requires action to break free.
        *   *Disoriented:* (Sonic pulses, flashbangs) -1 Cogs die, possibly cannot take Major Actions for one round.
        *   *Poisoned:* Take Toxin damage each round, Grit Checks disadvantaged.
        *   *Stressed:* -1 Bearing die, risk panic if Composure drops low.

## V. Magic and Technology

This system treats "magic" not as spellcasting, but as **Surface Phenomena** interacting with the world in strange ways, alongside **Aethelburg Technology**.

1.  **Aethelburg Technology:**
    *   **Usage:** Many devices (weapons, tools, sensors) work automatically or require a simple action. Complex devices (analytical engines, advanced propulsion) require a **Cogs + Engineering** or **Finesse + Tinkering** Check to operate effectively.
    *   **Maintenance & Repair:** Tech requires resources (**Parts**) and time to maintain. Repairing damaged tech requires **Parts** and a **Cogs + Engineering** Check. Difficulty depends on damage severity and tech complexity.
    *   **Resources:**
        *   **Fuel:** Some devices consume Fuel (coal, Aetheric cells). Track usage. Running out renders device inoperable.
        *   **Parts:** Generic resource for repair and modification. Found via salvage or requisitioned.
    *   **Malfunctions & Pressure:** Pushing tech (rerolls, special functions), poor maintenance, or environmental interference (see below) can cause **Pressure**. Track Pressure points on key devices. If Pressure reaches a threshold (e.g., 3), the device malfunctions (GM determines effect: shuts down, explodes, works erratically). A **Cogs + Engineering** Check (consuming Parts) can reduce Pressure or fix malfunctions. Critical Failures on tech-related checks can also add Pressure or cause immediate malfunction.
    *   **Invention/Modification:** Requires Downtime, significant **Parts**, potentially rare components (found on Surface?), and challenging **Cogs + Engineering/Tinkering** Checks. (See Optional Systems).
2.  **Surface Phenomena:**
    *   **Handling:** These are treated as environmental effects, creature abilities, or hazards, not spells cast by players.
    *   *Examples:*
        *   **Strange Energies (Chronarium Wreckage):** Requires **Grit + Endurance** Check to resist debilitating effects (e.g., fatigue, temporary mutation) or **Cogs + Science** Check to analyze/understand. Might cause tech malfunctions (adds Pressure).
        *   **Temporal Anomalies (Chronarium Wreckage):** Narrative effect, potential for saving throws (e.g., Bearing save vs. confusing visions, Finesse save vs. sudden slow-motion). Tech might behave unpredictably.
        *   **Potent Flora/Fauna Abilities (Verdant Maze):** Toxic spores (Grit + Endurance save vs. Poisoned), ensnaring vines (Finesse + Athletics check to escape), hypnotic pollen (Bearing + Endurance save vs. Mesmerized).
        *   **Resonant Frequencies (Salt Flats):** Disorienting sound (Bearing + Endurance save vs. Disoriented), potential to damage delicate tech (adds Pressure). May require **Cogs + Science** to find safe frequencies or shield gear.
    *   **Classification:** GM determines if a phenomenon is best resisted by Grit (physical resilience), Cogs (understanding/analysis), Finesse (avoidance), or Bearing (mental fortitude).
3.  **Integration & Adaptation:**
    *   **Tech vs. Surface:** Aethelburg tech may function poorly in certain environments (humidity rusts clockwork, energy fields disrupt Aetherics). This can be represented by increased **Pressure** gain, needing more frequent **Maintenance Checks**, or imposing penalties (-1 die) on usage checks.
    *   **Surface Adaptation:** Discovering surface materials (strange crystals, resilient plant fibers, energy-resonant fungi) might allow players, through successful **Cogs + Science/Engineering** Checks during Downtime, to modify their Aethelburg gear. This could grant resistance to specific environments, unlock new functions, or reduce resource consumption (e.g., integrating a resonant crystal to partially power a device). This is a key reward for exploration and discovery.

## VI. Recovery & Advancement

1.  **Health Recovery:** Characters naturally recover **Grit** points of Health after a full night's rest (approx. 8 hours) in relatively safe conditions. Successful **Cogs + Science** checks using a Medic kit can restore Health faster or stabilize dying characters. Specific technological devices or surface discoveries might offer other healing methods.
2.  **Composure Recovery:** Characters naturally recover **Bearing** points of Composure after a full night's rest or significant downtime spent relaxing or debriefing in safety. Addressing the source of stress or achieving minor victories can also restore Composure at the GM's discretion. Certain social interactions or discoveries might also aid recovery.
3.  **Character Advancement:** Characters advance at significant milestones in the campaign (e.g., completing a story arc, making a major discovery, surviving a critical encounter), as determined by the GM. At each milestone, players typically gain:
    *   **2-3 Points:** To distribute between increasing Attributes (max 5) or Skills (max 5, cannot exceed governing Attribute). Increasing an Attribute costs 2 points; increasing a Skill costs 1 point.
    *   **1 Talent:** Choose a new Talent from available options (see Optional Systems) or develop one based on campaign events (GM approval).

## VII. Optional Systems

1.  **Advanced Options & Specializations (Talents):** As players gain experience (see Advancement), they can gain **Talents**.
    *   **Talents:** Grant specific bonuses or abilities (e.g., *Master Artificer:* Reduce Parts cost for repairs; *Guild Enforcer:* Gain +1 die on Intimidation Checks; *Surface Adaptation Expert:* Choose one environment - gain +1 die on Survival/Endurance checks there; *Faction Loyalist:* Once per session, call in a minor favor related to your faction; *Quick Repair:* Use Engineering as a Minor Action once per scene to reduce Pressure on one device by 1).
    *   Players might gain Talents related to their Role, chosen Faction, or discoveries made.
2.  **Equipment Customization:** Beyond basic repairs, players can attempt to modify gear during Downtime.
    *   Requires: A plan, **Parts**, potentially rare Surface components, and a challenging **Cogs + Engineering** or **Finesse + Tinkering** Check.
    *   *Examples:* Adding a scope (+1 die Aim bonus), reinforcing armor (+1 AV, maybe -1 Finesse penalty), creating combination tools, integrating a Surface discovery into gear (e.g., bioluminescent fungus as a zero-fuel light source). Success might grant a permanent bonus; failure consumes resources; critical failure might damage the item or create a dangerous flaw.
3.  **Faction Mechanics:**
    *   **Reputation:** Track player character (or group) Reputation with key factions (Thorne/Stabilizers, Veridian/Prometheans, Vance/Cog&Compass) on a simple scale (e.g., -2 Hostile, -1 Unfriendly, 0 Neutral, +1 Friendly, +2 Allied).
    *   **Gaining/Losing Reputation:** Actions clearly aligning with a faction's goals increase Reputation; actions hindering them decrease it. Sharing valuable intel, completing faction-specific tasks, or public support/opposition can shift Reputation.
    *   **Effects:**
        *   *High Reputation (+1/+2):* Access to restricted information, better resource allocation (more Parts/Fuel), specialized gear requests, faction-specific Talents, political backup within the expedition.
        *   *Low Reputation (-1/-2):* Denied resources, given dangerous/undesirable tasks, face internal suspicion/sabotage, potential direct opposition from faction agents.
    *   GM uses Reputation to influence NPC reactions, mission briefings, resource availability, and introduce political intrigue plot hooks.

## VIII. Edge Cases & Resolution Guidance

*   **Adapting Tech to Surface Environments:** Requires specific resources found *on the surface* and Downtime activity with **Cogs + Science/Engineering** checks. Success might negate environmental penalties for that device or grant a bonus in that environment. Failure wastes resources. *Example:* Coating clockwork gears with slime from a cave slug (found via Survival/Science) to resist high humidity after a successful Engineering check.
*   **Temporal Distortions:** Treat primarily as narrative hazards. May impose conditions (Disoriented, Stressed), cause temporary loss of actions, or require saves (Bearing/Grit) to avoid worse effects (e.g., rapid aging - significant Health/Attribute damage, memory lapse). Tech might gain Pressure rapidly or malfunction unpredictably inside these zones. Understanding the pattern (**Cogs + Science/Investigation**) might allow safe passage.
*   **First Contact:** Handle primarily through roleplaying and **Bearing** skill checks (Persuade, Command, maybe Deceive depending on approach). Initial reactions depend heavily on the nature of the surface dwellers (hostile, curious, afraid). **Cogs + Lore/Science** might help understand their communication or culture. Failure could lead to conflict, misunderstanding, or lost opportunities. Success could lead to alliances, trade, or vital information.
*   **Political Disagreements/Sabotage:** Use **Bearing** skills (Persuade, Deceive, Intimidate) for direct confrontations. **Finesse + Stealth/Tinkering** might be used for subtle sabotage (if players resort to this). **Cogs + Investigation** can uncover sabotage attempts or hidden agendas. Faction Reputation plays a major role – NPCs are more likely to listen to/trust those with high Reputation in their faction and obstruct those with low Reputation. Conflicts might result in loss of resources, damaged morale (Composure damage tests might be required), or even removal from key roles within the expedition.
*   **Resource Scarcity:** Track **Fuel** and **Parts** meticulously. When resources run low:
    *   Tech cannot be easily repaired or requires cannibalizing other gear (destroying one item to fix another).
    *   Fuel-dependent devices become useless.
    *   Expedition goals might shift towards resource acquisition over exploration.
    *   Survival checks for foraging/finding shelter become critical.
    *   Morale drops (Composure damage tests might be required).
    *   Political tensions flare as factions blame each other or hoard remaining supplies (leading to Faction Reputation shifts and conflict)."

", agent="World building reviewer for {topic}
", status="completed", output="Here is the list of 20 detailed character sheets for the 'Beneath the Brass Canopy' campaign:

**1. Councilor Aris Thorne**

*   **Physical description:** Tall and impeccably dressed in tailored Aethelburg high fashion, often dark velvets and polished brass. Thorne possesses sharp, aristocratic features, cold grey eyes, and meticulously styled silvering hair. He moves with a politician's practiced grace, projecting calm authority.
*   **Backstory:** Hails from an old Founder family, inheriting wealth and influence built over generations within Aethelburg. Rose through the Council ranks via shrewd alliances and ruthless maneuvering, consolidating power within the Stabilizers faction. Believes his family's legacy, tied to the city's founding, grants him the right and duty to maintain the status quo, whatever the cost. Views the expedition as a calculated risk necessary to solidify his control and preempt rivals.
*   **Mindset:** Believes Aethelburg's stability and isolation are paramount, viewing the surface with deep suspicion rooted in curated family histories. Sees knowledge as power to be controlled, not shared, and considers the populace incapable of handling unsettling truths. Utterly convinced of his own necessity for the city's survival.
*   **Attributes:** Calculating, Ambitious, Ruthless, Charismatic.
*   **Motivations:** Primary: Maintain Aethelburg's isolation and his faction's political dominance by controlling information about the surface. Secondary: Uncover and suppress any evidence related to the Founders' dark pacts or the true reasons for the Sundering/Ascent.
*   **Relationships:** Leader of the Stabilizers faction, holds significant sway on the Council. Views Veridian Flux as a useful but dangerous tool and Kaelen Vance as a necessary, controllable instrument of Guild power. Distrusts the Undercity Network and sees High Speaker Eloise as a potential (though ideologically convenient) obstacle.
*   **Unique quirks/abilities:** Master Orator (capable of swaying council votes and public opinion). Obsessively polishes a family signet ring bearing a cryptic Founder symbol when deep in thought or under pressure.

This main quest arc follows the players' journey as the vanguard of Aethelburg's first official expedition to the surface world. Initially driven by the city's mandate for exploration and resource acquisition, the players descend into a world far stranger and more complex than the myths described. They uncover fragmented truths about the 'Sundering' that ravaged the world, the true reasons behind Aethelburg's 'Ascent', and the precarious nature of the Aetherium Core powering their city. As they delve deeper, they grapple with the environmental dangers, strange ecologies, and hidden histories of the surface, while simultaneously navigating the escalating political machinations of their sponsors back in Aethelburg (Thorne, Veridian, Vance). The core conflict evolves from simple exploration vs. survival to a complex struggle over the control of information, the interpretation of the past, and the future direction of both Aethelburg and potentially the surface itself. Players will be forced to make difficult choices about who to trust, what truths to reveal, and ultimately, where their loyalty lies – with their sky-bound home built on potentially flawed foundations, or with the challenging, dangerous, but perhaps more honest reality of the world below. The arc culminates in a discovery that fundamentally challenges Aethelburg's existence and forces the players to decide the fate of their expedition and potentially their entire society.

**2. Essential Adventures (Campaign Backbone):**

Here are three essential adventures forming the backbone of the main quest line, designed to align with the campaign's three-arc structure:

---

**Adventure 1: The Shifting Sands of Time (Arc 1: The Grand Descent)**

*   **Description:** Following their harrowing descent and the establishment of a precarious base camp, the expedition detects strange energy readings emanating from the 'Chronarium Wreckage' – the colossal, shattered remains of an unknown pre-Sundering machine half-buried in the landscape. Initial directives task the players with investigating the wreckage for salvageable technology and resources. However, upon arrival, they discover the area is plagued by localized temporal distortions – moments looping, objects aging or reverting rapidly, and glimpses of the past or potential futures flashing before their eyes. The wreckage isn't just ruins; it's a source of temporal instability.
*   **Theme Connection:** Hubris & Consequences (What kind of tech caused this?), Discovery & Fear of the Unknown (Temporal anomalies are terrifying and new), Known vs. Unknown (Challenges Aethelburg's understanding of pre-Sundering tech).
*   **Challenges:**
    *   **Navigating Temporal Instability:** Players must find ways to mitigate or navigate the time loops and distortions (e.g., using specialized gear, finding stable 'bubbles', timing movements carefully). Failure could result in temporary stat drains, lost time, separation, or unsettling visions.
    *   **Environmental Hazards:** The wreckage itself is unstable, with collapsing structures, residual energy fields, and potentially hostile automated defenses or mutated scavengers adapted to the temporal flux.
    *   **Information Recovery:** Key information exists in fragmented, damaged data logs scattered throughout the wreckage, often protected by hazards or temporal effects. Players need to decide which logs to prioritize and how to interpret corrupted data. Retrieving logs might require technical skills (repair), careful maneuvering (stealth/athletics), or even interacting with temporal echoes.
    *   **Initial Faction Contact:** Players might receive conflicting preliminary instructions via long-range communicator from Thorne (secure dangerous tech), Veridian (study anomalies), and Vance (map hazards, secure perimeter).
*   **Outcomes:**
    *   **Success:** Players recover partial logs hinting that pre-Sundering technology was far more advanced and dangerous than Aethelburg currently possesses, possibly related to temporal manipulation or unstable power sources. They gain insights into the nature of the surface's dangers and potentially acquire unique (but risky) technological samples or data fragments. Their report significantly influences Aethelburg's perception of the surface and the expedition's future goals. They might establish a method for somewhat predicting/mitigating the local anomalies.
    *   **Partial Success/Failure:** Key data logs are lost or misinterpreted. Players might suffer lasting effects from temporal exposure (minor paradoxes, unsettling memories). Their report back might be incomplete or misleading, leading to flawed strategies from Aethelburg command. A key piece of dangerous tech might be left behind or fall into the wrong hands (e.g., retrieved by unseen surface dwellers or automated systems). The expedition might deem the area too hazardous, limiting future exploration there.
*   **Required Actions (Multiple Approaches):**
    *   **Reach the Core:** Players must navigate the hazardous wreckage to reach the central control or data repository. (Pathfinding, Athletics, Hazard Neutralization via tech/combat).
    *   **Stabilize/Access Data:** Accessing the logs requires overcoming temporal distortions. (Tech skills to create stabilizers, Lore/Investigation to understand patterns, Perception to spot safe zones, potentially using salvaged components creatively).
    *   **Retrieve Samples/Logs:** Physical retrieval amidst hazards. (Stealth to avoid defenses/scavengers, Technical skills for extraction, Combat if necessary, careful handling of unstable artifacts).
    *   **Report Findings:** Transmit findings back to Aethelburg, choosing how to frame the discoveries based on potential factional leanings or player assessment of the danger. (Diplomacy/Deception in communication, prioritizing data transmission).
*   **Connections:** Introduces the advanced/dangerous nature of pre-Sundering tech. Provides first clues about the *type* of disaster the Sundering might have been. Establishes the surface as fundamentally strange, not just desolate. First test of player loyalty/reporting accuracy influencing Aethelburg factions. Sets up future quests investigating pre-Sundering ruins or temporal phenomena. Seeds the mystery of the Aetherium Core's origins.

---

**Adventure 2: Whispers from the Drowned City (Arc 2: Echoes from Below)**

*   **Description:** Following leads from the Chronarium Wreckage or other explorations, the players are directed (or discover independently) the location of the 'Sunken Archives' – remnants of a major pre-Sundering city, now partially flooded and overgrown, located within the 'Verdant Maze'. Legends in Aethelburg dismissed such places as myths. The Archives are rumored to hold vast repositories of knowledge from before the Ascent. Players must navigate the treacherous, maze-like ruins, dealing with strange flora/fauna adapted to the flooded environment and the structural instability of the waterlogged buildings. Their goal is to recover records pertaining to the Sundering, the era of the Founders, and the early history of Aethelburg.
*   **Theme Connection:** Truth & Manipulation (Recovered records contradict official Aethelburg history), Nature vs. Machine (Overgrown ruins, adapted life), Adaptation & Survival (Players must adapt tactics to the flooded, hazardous environment).
*   **Challenges:**
    *   **Environmental Navigation:** Traversing flooded sectors (requiring specialized gear, rafts, careful climbing), dealing with toxic spores from strange fungi, navigating structurally unsound ruins, and bypassing natural defenses (e.g., predatory plants, territorial aquatic creatures).
    *   **Information Integrity:** Records are water-damaged, fragmented, or stored in obsolete/alien formats. Deciphering them requires specific skills (Lore, Technology, Languages) and potentially specialized equipment salvaged or jury-rigged. Players might need to choose which records to save due to time/resource constraints.
    *   **Encountering Descendants/Survivors:** Players might discover isolated groups of surface dwellers who are descendants of those left behind, mutated humans, or perhaps sentient non-human life that has adapted to the ruins. Interaction requires diplomacy, caution, or potential conflict. These groups may possess unique knowledge or view the players as invaders/salvagers.
    *   **Faction Interference:** Agents loyal to Thorne might try to sabotage the recovery of inconvenient truths or steal specific records. Veridian might push players to take risks for potentially groundbreaking data. Vance might demand pragmatic mapping and threat assessment over historical deep-dives, potentially restricting access to certain areas deemed too dangerous. Communications back to Aethelburg become increasingly monitored or contested.
*   **Outcomes:**
    *   **Success:** Players recover significant historical data challenging Aethelburg's narrative. They might learn the Sundering was more complex than believed (perhaps self-inflicted or related to Aetherium tech), that the Founders weren't entirely heroic, or that the Ascent left many behind intentionally. They might forge alliances or rivalries with surface dwellers. This knowledge becomes a powerful political tool/burden. Factions in Aethelburg react strongly, increasing tensions.
    *   **Partial Success/Failure:** Critical records are lost, destroyed, or misinterpreted. Players might antagonize surface dwellers, making future interactions difficult. Sabotage attempts might succeed, feeding false information back to Aethelburg or depriving the players of key context. The recovered information might be too fragmented to be conclusive, sowing doubt rather than certainty. Players might be forced to abandon the Archives due to overwhelming hazards or resource depletion.
*   **Required Actions (Multiple Approaches):**
    *   **Locate Archive Vaults:** Navigate the Verdant Maze and the flooded city ruins to pinpoint key knowledge repositories. (Survival for navigation, Investigation/Perception to spot clues/paths, potentially using recovered maps or interacting with surface dwellers for guidance).
    *   **Access Vaults:** Overcome physical barriers (collapsed tunnels, locked vaults, natural blockages) and potentially automated security systems. (Engineering/Demolitions, Athletics/Climbing, Hacking/Technology, Creative problem-solving with environment).
    *   **Recover & Decipher Data:** Retrieve fragile/damaged records and make sense of them. (Lore/History, Technology/Decryption, Languages, careful handling/preservation techniques, potentially trading knowledge/resources with surface dwellers).
    *   **Manage Faction Agendas:** Deal with conflicting orders, potential sabotage, or requests for specific data from Aethelburg contacts or agents in the field. (Deception/Stealth to hide findings, Diplomacy to negotiate, Insight to detect agendas, potentially confronting/neutralizing agents).
*   **Connections:** Directly addresses the Key Mystery of Aethelburg's past and the truth of the Ascent. Develops the theme of Truth vs. Manipulation. Introduces potential surface factions/NPCs. Escalates the political conflict emanating from Aethelburg. Provides crucial context for the Aetherium Core's history and the Sundering's cause, leading towards Arc 3.

---

**Adventure 3: Beneath the Ashen Scar (Arc 3: The Surface Truth & Sky-Bound Reckoning)**

*   **Description:** Evidence gathered from previous expeditions points towards the 'Ashen Scar' – a vast, desolate region believed to be the epicenter of the Sundering. It's a place feared even in surface myths, potentially radioactive, toxic, or guarded by powerful entities/phenomena. Players must undertake a perilous journey to the heart of the Scar to uncover the ultimate truth behind the cataclysm and its potential connection to Aethelburg's Aetherium Core. This journey will test their accumulated knowledge, resources, and resolve to the absolute limit. They may discover the Sundering wasn't a single event but a process, or that its cause is intrinsically linked to the very technology keeping Aethelburg afloat, posing an existential threat or a terrible moral dilemma.
*   **Theme Connection:** Adaptation & Survival (Ultimate test of survival against extreme environment), Hubris & Consequences (Facing the direct result of past actions/tech), Truth & Manipulation (Uncovering the final, potentially devastating truth), Nature vs. Machine (The Scar as a testament to technology's destructive potential).
*   **Challenges:**
    *   **Extreme Environmental Hardship:** Navigating toxic zones, energy storms, mutated apex predators, and potentially reality-warping phenomena concentrated at the epicenter. Requires top-tier equipment, resource management, and potentially finding safe havens or ancient protective measures.
    *   **Guardians of the Truth:** The Scar's heart might be protected by powerful automated defense systems, immensely powerful mutated beings, psychic phenomena, or even descendants of the 'Founders' who chose to stay and guard the truth. Overcoming this requires tactical ingenuity, diplomacy, stealth, or overwhelming force.
    *   **The Aetherium Connection:** Discovering the truth might involve interacting directly with a damaged precursor Aetherium Core, a massive energy source, or technology that reveals the Core in Aethelburg is unstable, finite, or ethically compromised (e.g., powered by something horrific, or its use prevents the surface from healing).
    *   **The Final Choice:** Upon uncovering the truth, players face a critical decision with campaign-altering consequences:
        *   Transmit the full truth to Aethelburg (risking panic, civil war, Thorne's wrath, but potentially forcing change).
        *   Transmit a manipulated version (allying with a faction, attempting controlled change).
        *   Destroy the evidence/source of truth (maintaining the status quo, perhaps for perceived stability).
        *   Abandon Aethelburg and remain on the surface (using the knowledge to help surface dwellers or forge a new future).
        *   Attempt a radical solution (e.g., try to fix the source of the problem on the surface, find an alternative power source for Aethelburg).
*   **Outcomes:**
    *   **Discovery & Decision:** Regardless of success in overcoming hazards, the players uncover the central truth about the Sundering, the Ascent, and the Aetherium Core. Their subsequent choice dictates the campaign's finale.
    *   **Return to Aethelburg:** If they return, they face intense political fallout based on the information they bring and who they share it with. This could lead to open conflict between factions, the player characters being hailed as heroes or branded as traitors, and potentially radical changes to Aethelburg society or even its stability.
    *   **Remaining on Surface:** Players might become leaders or key figures among surface communities, using their knowledge and Aethelburg tech to aid survival or rebuilding efforts, potentially becoming legends or threats to Aethelburg in the long run.
    *   **Catastrophic Failure:** Players might perish in the Scar, or fail to uncover the truth, leaving Aethelburg ignorant and potentially doomed. They might accidentally trigger another disaster.
*   **Required Actions (Multiple Approaches):**
    *   **Journey to the Epicenter:** Traverse the dangerous Ashen Scar, managing resources and overcoming environmental threats. (Survival, Navigation, Piloting specialized vehicles if available, Resource Management, Hazard Gear proficiency).
    *   **Breach the Sanctum:** Overcome the guardians or defenses protecting the central truth. (Combat, Stealth, Diplomacy/Negotiation with sentient guardians, Technical skills to disable systems, Lore/Investigation to find bypasses).
    *   **Uncover the Truth:** Access and interpret the final pieces of information, likely involving interaction with ancient, powerful, or dangerous technology/entities. (Lore, Technology, Occult/Arcana if applicable, potentially moral/philosophical debates, personal sacrifice).
    *   **Make the Choice & Act:** Decide how to handle the discovered truth and implement that decision (secure transmission, data destruction, escape, confrontation). (Faction alignment, moral compass, long-term strategic thinking, potentially high-stakes skill challenges for transmission/sabotage/escape).
*   **Connections:** Culmination of all previous mysteries (Sundering, Ascent, Core). Directly confronts the campaign's central conflicts and themes. Forces resolution regarding player relationships with Aethelburg factions (Thorne, Veridian, Vance) and any surface allies/enemies. Outcome directly shapes the epilogue and potential future campaigns in this setting. Reveals the final truth about Key Lore elements (Founders, Aetherium Core, Sundering)."

**3. The Shifting Core Fragment**

*   **Description:** Veridian detects erratic, high-energy readings—possibly an unstable fragment of the Chronarium's power core—shifting location within a hazardous, temporally unstable wreckage zone. Veridian wants it analyzed (power secrets, stabilization methods). Thorne wants any "unconventional power sources" secured. Vance warns the area is lethally unstable.
*   **Challenges:** Tracking the unpredictably moving fragment (advanced sensors, environmental interpretation). Surviving extreme environmental hazards (collapse, energy fields, intense temporal flux). Devising safe containment/handling for the volatile fragment *before* reaching it (improvisation needed). Deciding who gets control if retrieved (Veridian, Thorne, Vance) – a major political decision.
*   **Outcomes:** Fragment secured yields powerful, volatile asset/plot device, critical lore (Precursor power/temporal tech). Player choice on delivery dictates major reputation shifts (+Rep chosen faction, -Rep others). Stabilizing in-situ provides partial data (+Rep Veridian), less risk/reward. Failure causes catastrophic energy release or loss of fragment (-Rep all). Mission abort leaves active threat (-Rep all).
*   **Required Actions:**
    *   Track & Predict fragment movement (Technology, Survival, Investigation).
    *   Navigate & Survive extreme hazards (Athletics, Saves, Tech vs hazards).

## Secondary Quests: Expedition Factions

**1. The Whispered Protocol (Stabilizers - Thorne)**

*   **Description:** A Thorne loyalist secretly tasks PCs with identifying and neutralizing an unauthorized data leak from the expedition network, bypassing Stabilizer filters. Thorne fears destabilizing truths reaching Aethelburg rivals or populace.
*   **Challenges:** Discreet investigation within the expedition. Identifying the leaker and the nature/importance of the leaked data. Discovering the leaker might have sympathetic motives (warning of danger, sharing science, exposing manipulation). Ethical dilemma: prioritize Thorne's "order" (suppression) or the potential value/truth of the leak? Risking faction fallout based on actions.
*   **Outcomes:** Siding with Thorne gains Stabilizer favor (access codes, intel channels, gear), potentially suppresses vital truth, increases suspicion. Protecting leak angers Thorne (-Rep), gains allies/truth/evidence, increases internal friction. Neutral/manipulative path is risky.
*   **Required Actions:**
    *   Investigation (Comms monitoring, log checks, searches, social engineering).
    *   Social Interaction (Questioning, negotiation, deception).
    *   Technical Skills (Signal tracing, decryption, disabling comms, data alteration).
    *   Stealth (Surveillance, accessing areas).
*   **Rewards:** Stabilizer standing/rewards, Secret Information (from leak or Thorne), Unique Contact (leaker or recipient), Evidence of Manipulation, Influence on expedition information flow.

**2. Calculated Risk Assessment (Promethean Directive - Veridian)**

*   **Description:** Veridian tasks PCs with secretly entering a hazardous zone cordoned off by Vance to deploy sensors/retrieve samples related to a potential scientific breakthrough. She provides prototype gear and stresses discretion.
*   **Challenges:** Circumventing Guild security/Vance's orders. Navigating genuinely dangerous environmental hazards. Assessing if Veridian's ambition outweighs the risks. Potential for unforeseen consequences from interacting with the phenomenon. Risk of severe disciplinary action if caught.
*   **Outcomes:** Success gains Promethean favor (+Rep Veridian), unique tech upgrades/data, potential new dangers/quests. Sours relations with Vance/Guild (-Rep). Getting caught leads to punishment (-Rep Both), damages trust. Aborting mission maintains Vance relations (+/-Rep Vance), disappoints Veridian (-Rep), loses opportunity.
*   **Required Actions:**
    *   Stealth & Infiltration (Bypass patrols/monitoring).
    *   Hazard Navigation (Survival, Athletics, Gear use).
    *   Technical Skills (Deploy sensors, handle samples, improvise solutions).
    *   Social Interaction (Optional: Bluff/persuade patrols if detected).
*   **Rewards:** Promethean standing/rewards, Unique Tech Upgrades (hazard suits, energy mods), Unique Biological Sample/Artifact Fragment, Map Data (hidden paths/resources), Lore (scientific breakthrough).

**3. Chain of Custody (Cog & Compass Guild - Vance)**

*   **Description:** Vance suspects subtle sabotage targeting Guild equipment/operations. He tasks the PCs (as discreet outsiders) with investigating the incidents, identifying the saboteur and motive, without causing panic or alerting the culprit.
*   **Challenges:** Forensic investigation of staged "accidents". Discovering the saboteur might have sympathetic motives (protesting Guild actions, protecting surface elements, rival Guild agent). Deciding whether to strictly follow Vance's orders or show leniency/cover up, risking Guild retribution. Potential for saboteur escalation.
*   **Outcomes:** Delivering culprit gains Guild favor (+Rep Vance), tangible rewards (scrip, gear, resources). May create enemies/moral issues. Protecting saboteur earns Guild enmity (-Rep Vance), gains allies/info related to saboteur's cause. Framing/obscuring truth is high risk/reward.
*   **Required Actions:**
    *   Investigation (Forensics, log analysis, interviews, searches).
    *   Social Interaction (Interviews, interrogation, gauging honesty).
    *   Technical Skills (Identify sabotage methods, disarm traps).
    *   Potential Combat/Capture (Apprehend saboteur).
*   **Rewards:** Guild standing/rewards, Advanced Security Gear, Access to Guild Resources/Maps, Secret Guild Protocols/Corruption Info, Hidden Resource Data, Leverage over Vance/Guild, Unique Sabotage Tools/Schematics."
