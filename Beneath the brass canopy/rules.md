# Beneath the Brass Canopy - Core Ruleset

## I. Core Mechanic: The Cog & Dice System

This system uses **six-sided dice (d6)**. When a character attempts an action where the outcome is uncertain and carries risk or consequence, they make a **Check**.

1.  **Determine Dice Pool:** The Game Master (GM) determines the relevant **Attribute** and **Skill** for the action. The base dice pool is **Attribute Rating + Skill Rating**.
    *   Situational modifiers (advantageous tools, favourable circumstances) might add 1-2 dice.
    *   Situational penalties (damaged gear, hazardous environment, hindering conditions) might remove 1-2 dice (to a minimum of 1 die).
2.  **Roll Dice:** Roll the dice in the pool.
3.  **Count Successes:** Each die showing a **4, 5, or 6** is a **Success**.
4.  **Determine Outcome:**
    *   **0 Successes:** **Failure.** The action fails, potentially with a complication or negative consequence (GM narrates).
    *   **1 Success:** **Partial Success / Success at Cost.** The character achieves their basic goal but might face a minor consequence, take longer, use more resources, or expose themselves to danger (Player choice or GM decision).
    *   **2 Successes:** **Full Success.** The character achieves their goal effectively and without significant issue.
    *   **3+ Successes:** **Critical Success.** The character achieves their goal exceptionally well, gaining an added benefit, completing the task faster, creating an advantage, or achieving a more significant outcome (GM narrates).
5.  **Critical Effects:**
    *   **Complication (Optional Rule):** If a Check results in 0 Successes *and* one or more '1's are rolled, the GM introduces a significant complication or setback related to the failed action (e.g., tool breaks, loud noise attracts attention, social blunder worsens situation).
    *   **Pushing Your Luck:** Before rolling, a player can choose to 'Push'. They gain +1 die to their pool, but any '1' rolled on the check cancels out one Success. This represents taking risks for greater reward.

## II. Character Creation

1.  **Concept:** Define your character's core idea (e.g., Gear-obsessed Engineer, By-the-book Aeronaut Guard, Curious Cartographer's Scion).
2.  **Attributes:** Characters have four Attributes, representing core capabilities. Distribute 8 points among them (minimum 1, maximum 4 in any Attribute at creation).
    *   **Grit:** Physical resilience, endurance, resisting harm, close combat prowess.
    *   **Cogs:** Intelligence, reasoning, technical knowledge, perception, scientific understanding.
    *   **Finesse:** Agility, precision, stealth, ranged attacks, delicate manipulation.
    *   **Bearing:** Presence, social influence, leadership, willpower, deception.
3.  **Skills:** Skills represent specific training or aptitude. Each Attribute governs related Skills. You start with **10 points** to distribute among Skills. No Skill can start higher than **3**. A Skill cannot be higher than its governing Attribute. Starting with a Skill at 0 means you are untrained (roll only Attribute dice).
    *   **Grit Skills:** Athletics (Climbing, Jumping), Endurance (Resisting fatigue/hazards), Melee (Close combat), Survival (Foraging, Shelter, Tracking).
    *   **Cogs Skills:** Engineering (Repair, Build, Understand tech), Investigation (Gather clues, Analyze data), Lore (History, Factions, Legends), Science (Analyze phenomena, Biology, Chemistry).
    *   **Finesse Skills:** Marksmanship (Ranged attacks), Piloting (Handling vehicles/automatons), Stealth (Moving unseen, Hiding), Tinkering (Delicate repairs, Lockpicking, Gadgeteering).
    *   **Bearing Skills:** Command (Leading others, Giving orders), Deceive (Lying, Misdirection), Persuade (Negotiation, Diplomacy), Intimidate (Coercion, Threats).
4.  **Origin:** Choose an Origin reflecting their Aethelburg background (e.g., Cartographer's Scion, Clockwork Prodigy, Disgraced Academic, Sky-Sick Soul, Guild Prospector, Cog-Baron's Agent, Aeronaut Guard, Undercity Fixer).
    *   *Benefit:* Grants +1 to a specific Skill (potentially exceeding the starting cap of 3, but not the Attribute cap) OR a unique narrative Hook/Contact related to their background.
5.  **Role:** Choose an Expedition Role (e.g., Scientist, Engineer, Guard, Scout, Medic, Quartermaster).
    *   *Benefit:* Grants a starting 'Aethelburg Tech Package' relevant to the role (see Section VI - this is essential starting equipment) and proficiency (+1 die when using) with one specific type of related equipment (e.g., Scientist: Analytical Kit; Guard: Standard Issue Steam Rifle). Characters also receive basic adventuring gear (clothing, rations, basic tools).
6.  **Derived Stats:**
    *   **Health:** Grit x 3. Represents physical resilience. Damage reduces Health. Reaching 0 Health means incapacitated.
    *   **Composure:** Bearing x 3. Represents mental fortitude. Fear, stress, and certain phenomena reduce Composure. Reaching 0 Composure means panicked, catatonic, or otherwise mentally overwhelmed.
    *   **Defense:** Base 1 + Finesse / 2 (round down). Represents base ability to avoid hits. Armor adds to this.
    *   **Resourcefulness:** Cogs / 2 (round down). Represents starting bonus 'Parts' or 'Supplies' (see Section VI).
7.  **Finishing Touches:** Name, appearance, personality, a personal goal, and a secret or connection to one of the campaign's mysteries or factions.

## III. Skill System & Action Economy

*   **Using Skills:** When the outcome is uncertain, make a Check using Attribute + Skill.
    *   **Exploration:** Survival (Tracking, Foraging), Piloting (Navigating terrain with vehicles), Lore (Identifying landmarks from myths), Investigation (Mapping terrain features).
    *   **Interaction:** Persuade, Deceive, Intimidate, Command (Used in social encounters, political maneuvering within the expedition). Bearing is the key Attribute.
    *   **Technical:** Engineering (Repairing gear, building shelter reinforcements), Tinkering (Modifying gadgets, disabling traps), Science (Analyzing samples, understanding anomalies). Cogs is the key Attribute.
    *   **Survival:** Endurance (Resisting hazards), Survival (Finding food/water, building shelter), Science (Identifying safe flora/fauna). Grit and Cogs are key.
    *   **Investigation:** Investigation (Finding clues, analyzing scenes), Lore (Connecting findings to Aethelburg history/legends), Science (Understanding mechanism of ruins/anomalies). Cogs is key.
*   **Action Economy (Out of Combat):** Time is more fluid. Actions take narrative time. Complex tasks (repairing complex machinery, detailed research) might require multiple Checks or represent 'Downtime' activities.
*   **Action Economy (In Combat / Structured Time):**
    *   Turns are taken in rounds. Determine initiative at the start of combat with a **Finesse Check**; highest result goes first, proceeding downwards. Ties are broken by Finesse Attribute, then player choice.
    *   On your turn, you can take:
        *   **One Major Action:** Attack, Use a complex Skill/Technological Device, Attempt a maneuver (e.g., Disarm, Shove), Stabilize a fallen comrade (requires Medic kit and Cogs+Science check).
        *   **One Minor Action:** Move up to your Speed (approx. 10 meters), Aim (+1 die to next attack), Draw/Stow weapon/item, Interact simply (open door, speak briefly), Take Cover (+1 Defense).
        *   **One Reaction (Outside your turn):** Perform an Opportunity Attack (if foe leaves melee), attempt to Dodge (make a Finesse Check vs Attack result - if successes equal or exceed attack successes, negate the hit), use a specific defensive tech ability.

## IV. Combat System

1.  **Turn Structure:** Initiative determines order (see Action Economy). Each participant takes a turn each round.
2.  **Actions in Combat:** Use the Action Economy described above (Major, Minor, Reaction).
3.  **Making Attacks:**
    *   **Melee:** Grit + Melee Check vs. Target's Defense.
    *   **Ranged:** Finesse + Marksmanship Check vs. Target's Defense.
    *   *Success:* On a Full Success (2+ successes), the attack hits and deals damage. A Partial Success (1 success) might mean hitting but dealing less damage, hitting armor only, or hitting but exposing yourself to a counter-attack (GM choice based on context).
4.  **Damage & Defense:**
    *   **Damage:** Weapons have a base Damage rating (e.g., Steam Rifle: 4 damage). Add +1 damage for each success beyond the first on the attack Check.
    *   **Damage Types:**
        *   *Physical:* Standard impact, cuts, etc.
        *   *Piercing:* Ignores 1-2 points of Armor (specified by weapon/attack).
        *   *Steam/Heat:* Burns, potential 'Overheated' condition.
        *   *Toxin/Acid:* Damage over time, potential 'Poisoned' condition.
        *   *Energy:* From surface phenomena or strange tech, effects vary.
        *   *Stress:* Affects Composure instead of Health.
    *   **Armor:** Provides an Armor Value (AV). Reduce incoming Physical/Piercing damage by AV. Heavy armor might impose a Finesse penalty. Armor can be damaged or ablated by specific attacks or critical failures.
    *   **Taking Damage:** Subtract final damage from Health. If reduced to 0 Health, character is incapacitated (dying, unconscious - GM determines specifics). Requires stabilization (Major Action, Medic kit, Cogs+Science check) to prevent death.
5.  **Special Effects & Conditions:**
    *   **Critical Hit (3+ Successes on Attack):** Maximize weapon damage OR add a relevant Condition OR bypass some Armor.
    *   **Critical Failure (0 Successes + Complication):** Weapon jams/breaks, hit an ally, expose self to counter-attack.
    *   **Conditions (Examples):** Impose penalties (-1/-2 dice to relevant checks), limit actions, or cause ongoing damage/stress.
        *   *Overheated:* (From steam tech/heat) -1 Finesse die, possible minor Heat damage each turn until cooled.
        *   *Entangled:* (Vines, nets) Cannot Move, Finesse Checks disadvantaged. Requires action to break free.
        *   *Disoriented:* (Sonic pulses, flashbangs) -1 Cogs die, possibly cannot take Major Actions for one round.
        *   *Poisoned:* Take Toxin damage each round, Grit Checks disadvantaged.
        *   *Stressed:* -1 Bearing die, risk panic if Composure drops low.

## V. Magic and Technology

This system treats "magic" not as spellcasting, but as **Surface Phenomena** interacting with the world in strange ways, alongside **Aethelburg Technology**.

1.  **Aethelburg Technology:**
    *   **Usage:** Many devices (weapons, tools, sensors) work automatically or require a simple action. Complex devices (analytical engines, advanced propulsion) require a **Cogs + Engineering** or **Finesse + Tinkering** Check to operate effectively.
    *   **Maintenance & Repair:** Tech requires resources (**Parts**) and time to maintain. Repairing damaged tech requires **Parts** and a **Cogs + Engineering** Check. Difficulty depends on damage severity and tech complexity.
    *   **Resources:**
        *   **Fuel:** Some devices consume Fuel (coal, Aetheric cells). Track usage. Running out renders device inoperable.
        *   **Parts:** Generic resource for repair and modification. Found via salvage or requisitioned.
    *   **Malfunctions & Pressure:** Pushing tech (rerolls, special functions), poor maintenance, or environmental interference (see below) can cause **Pressure**. Track Pressure points on key devices. If Pressure reaches a threshold (e.g., 3), the device malfunctions (GM determines effect: shuts down, explodes, works erratically). A **Cogs + Engineering** Check (consuming Parts) can reduce Pressure or fix malfunctions. Critical Failures on tech-related checks can also add Pressure or cause immediate malfunction.
    *   **Invention/Modification:** Requires Downtime, significant **Parts**, potentially rare components (found on Surface?), and challenging **Cogs + Engineering/Tinkering** Checks. (See Optional Systems).
2.  **Surface Phenomena:**
    *   **Handling:** These are treated as environmental effects, creature abilities, or hazards, not spells cast by players.
    *   *Examples:*
        *   **Strange Energies (Chronarium Wreckage):** Requires **Grit + Endurance** Check to resist debilitating effects (e.g., fatigue, temporary mutation) or **Cogs + Science** Check to analyze/understand. Might cause tech malfunctions (adds Pressure).
        *   **Temporal Anomalies (Chronarium Wreckage):** Narrative effect, potential for saving throws (e.g., Bearing save vs. confusing visions, Finesse save vs. sudden slow-motion). Tech might behave unpredictably.
        *   **Potent Flora/Fauna Abilities (Verdant Maze):** Toxic spores (Grit + Endurance save vs. Poisoned), ensnaring vines (Finesse + Athletics check to escape), hypnotic pollen (Bearing + Endurance save vs. Mesmerized).
        *   **Resonant Frequencies (Salt Flats):** Disorienting sound (Bearing + Endurance save vs. Disoriented), potential to damage delicate tech (adds Pressure). May require **Cogs + Science** to find safe frequencies or shield gear.
    *   **Classification:** GM determines if a phenomenon is best resisted by Grit (physical resilience), Cogs (understanding/analysis), Finesse (avoidance), or Bearing (mental fortitude).
3.  **Integration & Adaptation:**
    *   **Tech vs. Surface:** Aethelburg tech may function poorly in certain environments (humidity rusts clockwork, energy fields disrupt Aetherics). This can be represented by increased **Pressure** gain, needing more frequent **Maintenance Checks**, or imposing penalties (-1 die) on usage checks.
    *   **Surface Adaptation:** Discovering surface materials (strange crystals, resilient plant fibers, energy-resonant fungi) might allow players, through successful **Cogs + Science/Engineering** Checks during Downtime, to modify their Aethelburg gear. This could grant resistance to specific environments, unlock new functions, or reduce resource consumption (e.g., integrating a resonant crystal to partially power a device). This is a key reward for exploration and discovery.

## VI. Recovery & Advancement

1.  **Health Recovery:** Characters naturally recover **Grit** points of Health after a full night's rest (approx. 8 hours) in relatively safe conditions. Successful **Cogs + Science** checks using a Medic kit can restore Health faster or stabilize dying characters. Specific technological devices or surface discoveries might offer other healing methods.
2.  **Composure Recovery:** Characters naturally recover **Bearing** points of Composure after a full night's rest or significant downtime spent relaxing or debriefing in safety. Addressing the source of stress or achieving minor victories can also restore Composure at the GM's discretion. Certain social interactions or discoveries might also aid recovery.
3.  **Character Advancement:** Characters advance at significant milestones in the campaign (e.g., completing a story arc, making a major discovery, surviving a critical encounter), as determined by the GM. At each milestone, players typically gain:
    *   **2-3 Points:** To distribute between increasing Attributes (max 5) or Skills (max 5, cannot exceed governing Attribute). Increasing an Attribute costs 2 points; increasing a Skill costs 1 point.
    *   **1 Talent:** Choose a new Talent from available options (see Optional Systems) or develop one based on campaign events (GM approval).

## VII. Optional Systems

1.  **Advanced Options & Specializations (Talents):** As players gain experience (see Advancement), they can gain **Talents**.
    *   **Talents:** Grant specific bonuses or abilities (e.g., *Master Artificer:* Reduce Parts cost for repairs; *Guild Enforcer:* Gain +1 die on Intimidation Checks; *Surface Adaptation Expert:* Choose one environment - gain +1 die on Survival/Endurance checks there; *Faction Loyalist:* Once per session, call in a minor favor related to your faction; *Quick Repair:* Use Engineering as a Minor Action once per scene to reduce Pressure on one device by 1).
    *   Players might gain Talents related to their Role, chosen Faction, or discoveries made.
2.  **Equipment Customization:** Beyond basic repairs, players can attempt to modify gear during Downtime.
    *   Requires: A plan, **Parts**, potentially rare Surface components, and a challenging **Cogs + Engineering** or **Finesse + Tinkering** Check.
    *   *Examples:* Adding a scope (+1 die Aim bonus), reinforcing armor (+1 AV, maybe -1 Finesse penalty), creating combination tools, integrating a Surface discovery into gear (e.g., bioluminescent fungus as a zero-fuel light source). Success might grant a permanent bonus; failure consumes resources; critical failure might damage the item or create a dangerous flaw.
3.  **Faction Mechanics:**
    *   **Reputation:** Track player character (or group) Reputation with key factions (Thorne/Stabilizers, Veridian/Prometheans, Vance/Cog&Compass) on a simple scale (e.g., -2 Hostile, -1 Unfriendly, 0 Neutral, +1 Friendly, +2 Allied).
    *   **Gaining/Losing Reputation:** Actions clearly aligning with a faction's goals increase Reputation; actions hindering them decrease it. Sharing valuable intel, completing faction-specific tasks, or public support/opposition can shift Reputation.
    *   **Effects:**
        *   *High Reputation (+1/+2):* Access to restricted information, better resource allocation (more Parts/Fuel), specialized gear requests, faction-specific Talents, political backup within the expedition.
        *   *Low Reputation (-1/-2):* Denied resources, given dangerous/undesirable tasks, face internal suspicion/sabotage, potential direct opposition from faction agents.
    *   GM uses Reputation to influence NPC reactions, mission briefings, resource availability, and introduce political intrigue plot hooks.

## VIII. Edge Cases & Resolution Guidance

*   **Adapting Tech to Surface Environments:** Requires specific resources found *on the surface* and Downtime activity with **Cogs + Science/Engineering** checks. Success might negate environmental penalties for that device or grant a bonus in that environment. Failure wastes resources. *Example:* Coating clockwork gears with slime from a cave slug (found via Survival/Science) to resist high humidity after a successful Engineering check.
*   **Temporal Distortions:** Treat primarily as narrative hazards. May impose conditions (Disoriented, Stressed), cause temporary loss of actions, or require saves (Bearing/Grit) to avoid worse effects (e.g., rapid aging - significant Health/Attribute damage, memory lapse). Tech might gain Pressure rapidly or malfunction unpredictably inside these zones. Understanding the pattern (**Cogs + Science/Investigation**) might allow safe passage.
*   **First Contact:** Handle primarily through roleplaying and **Bearing** skill checks (Persuade, Command, maybe Deceive depending on approach). Initial reactions depend heavily on the nature of the surface dwellers (hostile, curious, afraid). **Cogs + Lore/Science** might help understand their communication or culture. Failure could lead to conflict, misunderstanding, or lost opportunities. Success could lead to alliances, trade, or vital information.
*   **Political Disagreements/Sabotage:** Use **Bearing** skills (Persuade, Deceive, Intimidate) for direct confrontations. **Finesse + Stealth/Tinkering** might be used for subtle sabotage (if players resort to this). **Cogs + Investigation** can uncover sabotage attempts or hidden agendas. Faction Reputation plays a major role – NPCs are more likely to listen to/trust those with high Reputation in their faction and obstruct those with low Reputation. Conflicts might result in loss of resources, damaged morale (Composure damage tests might be required), or even removal from key roles within the expedition.
*   **Resource Scarcity:** Track **Fuel** and **Parts** meticulously. When resources run low:
    *   Tech cannot be easily repaired or requires cannibalizing other gear (destroying one item to fix another).
    *   Fuel-dependent devices become useless.
    *   Expedition goals might shift towards resource acquisition over exploration.
    *   Survival checks for foraging/finding shelter become critical.
    *   Morale drops (Composure damage tests might be required).
    *   Political tensions flare as factions blame each other or hoard remaining supplies (leading to Faction Reputation shifts and conflict).
