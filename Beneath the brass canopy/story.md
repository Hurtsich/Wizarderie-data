# Beneath the Brass Canopy: Lore & History

## The Ascent of Aethelburg: A History Forged in Steam and Shadow

The world below is a tapestry woven from whispers, myths, and fragmented data-slates – a place spoken of in hushed tones in the gas-lit taverns of Aethelburg or debated in sanitized theories within the halls of the Athenaeum Mechanica. For the citizens of the magnificent floating metropolis, the surface, the 'Down Below,' is less a place and more a concept, a historical footnote to their own miraculous existence among the clouds. The truth, as always, is far more complex and dangerous.

Centuries ago, the world was not suspended. Cities sprawled across continents, powered by burgeoning technologies that blended intricate clockwork with potent, volatile energy sources derived from deep terrestrial veins – a precursor to Aethelburg's own Aetherium science. This era, often romanticized as the 'Age of Titans' due to the colossal constructs and ambitious projects undertaken, was marked by fierce rivalries between city-states and burgeoning empires. Innovation bred hubris, and the relentless exploitation of the planet's resources led to increasing instability.

The catalyst for the end wasn't a single war or discovery, but a convergence of ecological collapse and technological catastrophe known as **The Sundering**. Accounts vary wildly: some speak of world-spanning toxic Blight storms unleashed by resource wars, others of runaway geological reactions triggered by deep-core energy extraction, and still others whisper of reality itself fraying under the strain of reckless chrono-spatial experiments. Whatever the precise sequence, the surface world became increasingly hostile. Skies choked with caustic miasma, lands twisted by uncontrolled energies, and monstrous flora and fauna mutated by the poisoned environment became terrifyingly common. Civilisation fractured.

Amidst this chaos, a coalition of brilliant, perhaps ruthless, visionaries – scientists, engineers, philosophers, and industrialists known collectively as the Founders – conceived of a radical solution: escape. Not to the stars, but upwards, above the Blight, the miasma, and the terrestrial horrors. Their chosen location was the region then known as Silvermire, a hub of technological innovation and Aetheric research. Led by figures now lost to precise history but venerated in vague terms (like the mythical 'Great Architect'), they repurposed existing infrastructure and poured resources into constructing **Aethelburg**.

The heart of their ambition was the **Aetherium Core**, a colossal engine harnessing geo-resonant energies, stabilized and amplified through intricate clockwork mechanisms and esoteric field science. Its power source remains Aethelburg's most guarded secret, but it allowed the city, built upon massive interlocking platforms and structural spars, to defy gravity.

**The Ascent** itself was not a gentle lift-off but a chaotic, desperate exodus. Not everyone could be saved. Choices were made – brutal, pragmatic choices – about who would board the rising city and who would be left behind. Records of this period are heavily curated or simply lost, replaced by heroic narratives of the Founders' wisdom and the city's salvation. The journey upwards through the turbulent, Blight-choked lower atmosphere was perilous, scarring the lower decks of the city and fostering a deep-seated cultural fear of the lethal 'Canopy' – the perpetual, toxic cloud layer below Aethelburg.

Once safely above the worst of the surface chaos, Aethelburg entered the **Silent Century**. Contact with the surface ceased entirely. Survival demanded inward focus: refining the Core's stability, establishing governance (the precursor to the current Council), developing hydroponics and atmospheric condensers, and building the intricate society of guilds, districts, and clockwork marvels seen today. Knowledge of the Down Below faded into myth. The Sundering became a cautionary tale about hubris (ironically), the surface a cursed realm, and Aethelburg a sanctuary, a testament to ingenuity and survival.

Now, generations later, the city thrives, a beacon of brass and steam against the endless blue. Yet, resources are finite, the Core's long-term stability is debated in hushed tones by artificers like Veridian Flux, and political factions like Councilor Thorne's Stabilizers clash with those pushing for new frontiers, like Guild-Captain Vance's resource-hungry Cog & Compass Guild. The pressure builds. Old myths are being questioned. The time has come to look down, to breach the Canopy, and discover what truly lies beneath.

## Landmarks of the Sky and Surface

**Aethelburg Locations:**

1.  **The Grand Cogworks (District Mechanica):** The industrial heart of Aethelburg. A labyrinth of factories, foundries, steam conduits, and gear-driven machinery stretching across several lower and mid-level platforms. The air hums with rhythmic clanging and hisses with escaping steam. Home to the Artificer's Guild headquarters and countless workshops. *Significance:* Center of production, technological innovation (Veridian Flux's power base), and labor. Prone to industrial accidents and worker unrest (potential connection to the Undercity Network).
2.  **Skyport Imperia:** The main docking and launch facility, situated on Aethelburg's uppermost, outward-facing platforms. Huge gantries, mooring towers for dirigibles, customs houses, and warehouses bustle with activity. This is where the expedition vessel launches. *Significance:* Hub of trade (what little exists between city levels), travel, and security (Guild-Captain Vance often oversees operations here). A place of arrivals, departures, and potential sabotage.
3.  **The Gilded Spire (Council Apex):** The seat of Aethelburg's governance, located atop the centralmost spire. Houses the Council Chambers, residences for high-ranking officials like Councilor Thorne, opulent halls, and secure archives (containing potentially sanitized histories). *Significance:* Center of political power, intrigue, and decision-making. Access is heavily restricted. Thorne holds considerable influence here.
4.  **The Undercity Labyrinth (The Rivets):** The sprawling, dimly lit lower decks and maintenance shafts of Aethelburg. A maze of pipes, catwalks, cramped living quarters, hidden markets, and waste reclamation units. Home to the city's working class, engineers performing essential maintenance, and less savory elements. *Significance:* Represents the forgotten foundation of the city, rife with social tension, secrets, and the Undercity Network's operations. Players might have contacts or enemies here.
5.  **The Athenaeum Mechanica:** A grand repository of knowledge, filled with data-slates, schematics, historical texts (often edited), and scientific instruments. Dominated by towering brass orreries and humming analytical engines. Chief Artificer Veridian Flux spends much of her time here. *Significance:* Center of learning and research. Holds clues about Aethelburg's technology, censored history, and perhaps forgotten details about the surface or previous expeditions.

**Surface Locations:**

6.  **The Verdant Maze (Remnants of the Silvermire Citadel):** *(Expanded)* Once a sprawling urban and technological center (likely near Aethelburg's origin point), now consumed by hyper-aggressive, mutated flora. Twisted metal spars and ferrocrete structures jut from seas of strangling vines, toxic fungi, and colossal predatory plants. Symbiotic machines, remnants of the Citadel's automation, still patrol erratically, sometimes entangled with or even 'piloted' by plant growths. *Geography:* Dense, multi-level jungle ruin. *Inhabitants:* Mutated flora, predatory fauna, malfunctioning automata, potential primitive human tribes adapted to the Green. *Significance:* Direct link to Aethelburg's origins, potential source of pre-Ascent tech, extreme environmental hazard. Holds clues about the Sundering's ecological impact.
7.  **The Whispering Salt Flats & Crystal Spires:** *(Expanded)* An immense, blindingly white salt flat stretching to the horizon, punctuated by towering crystalline structures that resonate with atmospheric energy, creating eerie sonic phenomena (the 'whispers'). Sub-surface, accessible via fissures or collapsed areas, lie ancient brine tunnels and perhaps preserved pre-Sundering structures. The crystals hum with power, potentially related to the Aetherium Core's principles. *Geography:* Vast, arid flatland, colossal crystal formations, subterranean tunnels. *Inhabitants:* Crystalline predators adapted to sonic hunting, extremophile organisms, perhaps nomadic scavengers. *Significance:* Alien landscape, potential energy source, location of unique resources, navigational hazard due to disorientation and sonic effects. Holds clues about unusual energy phenomena and potentially non-standard life.
8.  **The Chronarium Wreckage (The Fallen Cog):** *(Expanded)* The catastrophic impact site of what appears to be a colossal, clockwork/Aetheric device – perhaps a weapon, a terraforming engine, or even a failed precursor to Aethelburg. Time behaves erratically within its debris field; pockets of slow-motion, rapid aging, or temporal loops flicker in and out of existence. Automated defenses may still function sporadically. *Geography:* Shattered machine landscape, unstable ground, localized temporal distortions. *Inhabitants:* Malfunctioning automata, temporal echoes/ghosts, creatures warped by time fluxes. *Significance:* Source of extreme danger and bizarre discoveries, hints at the advanced (and potentially reckless) technology of the pre-Sundering era, potential source of temporal paradoxes or unique technological salvage.
9.  **The Ashen Scar:** A vast, desolate region perpetually covered in fine grey-black ash. Twisted, blackened trees stand like skeletal fingers against a bruised sky. The air tastes metallic, and strange energies linger. This appears to be ground zero for a major Sundering event – perhaps a weapon impact or a massive industrial meltdown. *Geography:* Ash dunes, petrified forests, irradiated zones, toxic air pockets. *Inhabitants:* Ash Golems (elemental/constructs?), radiation-resistant scavengers, desperate survivors eking out a miserable existence. *Significance:* Direct evidence of the Sundering's destructive power, hazardous environment, source of unique geological/energy readings, potential location of buried pre-Ascent military tech or facilities.
10. **The Sunken Archives:** The flooded ruins of what was clearly a major repository of knowledge – a library, university, or data center – now submerged beneath a vast, eerily clear lake or inland sea created by post-Sundering geographical shifts. Water-tight vaults or magically sealed chambers might still protect invaluable records. *Geography:* Underwater ruins, submerged structures, potentially dangerous aquatic life adapted to the flooded environment. *Inhabitants:* Mutated aquatic life, amphibious scavengers, possibly automated archival guardians still functioning. *Significance:* Potential trove of uncensored history, scientific knowledge, or maps of the old world, extremely difficult to access, requires specialized equipment or adaptation.

    *   **Campaign Involvement:** Potential source of information, illicit gear, or unexpected aid for the players, particularly if they are sympathetic or need to operate outside official channels. Could also be antagonists if the expedition threatens their operations or if bribed by other factions. May possess unique knowledge about Aethelburg's flaws or hidden passages.

## Defining Historical Events

1.  **The Sundering (Approx. 400-500 years ago):** The period of cascading catastrophes (ecological, technological, possibly warfare-related) that rendered much of the surface world hostile and led to the collapse of the pre-Ascent civilizations. Its exact nature is obscured by time and deliberate obfuscation, forming a core mystery.
2.  **The Great Architect's Vision (Approx. 350-400 years ago):** The period encompassing the conceptualization, design, and initial construction of Aethelburg and its Aetherium Core within the Silvermire region, driven by the Founders amidst the chaos of the Sundering. Represents a monumental feat of engineering and ambition.
3.  **The Ascent (Approx. 300 years ago):** The specific, chaotic event when Aethelburg lifted off from the surface, separating from the world below and carrying a select population upwards. Marked by difficult choices, likely betrayal, and the severing of ties with those left behind. The official narrative emphasizes heroism; the reality was likely far messier.
4.  **The Silent Century (Approx. 300-200 years ago):** The first hundred years after the Ascent. A period of isolation, consolidation, technological refinement (stabilizing the Core, developing life support), formation of Aethelburg's core institutions (Council, Guilds), and the deliberate or accidental loss/suppression of detailed knowledge about the surface. Myths replaced history.
5.  **The Cogwork Riots (Approx. 70 years ago):** A period of significant civil unrest centered in the Grand Cogworks and Undercity Labyrinth. Sparked by resource shortages, dangerous working conditions, and perceived inequities enforced by the Guilds and Council. Brutally suppressed, but led to minor reforms and cemented distrust between the lower decks and the elites. Served as a catalyst for the Undercity Network's quiet growth.

## Secrets and Legends

*   **The True Nature of the Aetherium Core:** It's more than just steam and gears. Legends whisper it's powered by a captured elemental, a shard of a fallen star, the collective psychic resonance of the city, or even something siphoned from the supposedly dead surface world itself. Veridian Flux is obsessed with discovering this truth. Its potential instability or dependence on unknown factors is a critical secret.
*   **The Founders' Pact:** Whispers suggest the Founders made dark bargains or terrible compromises to achieve the Ascent – deals with unknown entities, sacrifices of certain populations left behind, or the use of forbidden technologies whose consequences are still felt. Evidence might lie hidden in secure Council archives or deep within the Chronarium Wreckage.
*   **Echoes of Descent:** Despite official histories claiming this is the *first* expedition, persistent rumors and fragmented data suggest previous attempts were made, perhaps during the Silent Century or even more recently. What happened to them? Were they lost, destroyed, or did they find something so terrifying that their records were erased by factions like the Stabilizers? Anomalous signals or wreckage found on the surface could point to these lost voyages.
*   **The Surface Bloom Prophecy:** A fragmented, often dismissed prophecy found in obscure texts within the Athenaeum. It speaks not of a dead world, but a dormant one, destined to "bloom" or "reawaken," revealing either paradise or a new form of horror. Some Traditionalists fear it, while some Prometheans see it as a sign of untapped potential. Its true meaning is a central mystery.
*   **The Silent Watchers:** A persistent myth among sky-sailors and Undercity dwellers. They speak of fleeting shapes glimpsed in the cloud layer below Aethelburg or strange energy signatures detected from the surface – not random phenomena, but suggesting something intelligent is observing the floating city. Are they survivors, alien life, or automated remnants of the past? Their existence, if proven, would shatter Aethelburg's sense of isolation.
*   **Thorne's Hidden Agenda:** Councilor Thorne's motivations may go beyond simple stability. Perhaps his family lineage has a dark secret tied to the Ascent, or he knows something specific about the surface (or the Core) that he desperately needs to remain hidden. His suppression of truth might be deeply personal.
*   **Veridian's Secret Project:** Chief Artificer Flux may be pursuing research far beyond her official mandate, possibly attempting to replicate dangerous pre-Sundering technologies or even communicate with whatever powers the Aetherium Core, risking the entire city's safety for knowledge.
*   **Vance's Contingency:** Guild-Captain Vance, ever the pragmatist, likely has secret orders or contingency plans from the Cog & Compass Guild regarding resource exploitation or dealing with unforeseen threats/discoveries, potentially putting her at odds with the official mission parameters or the players' choices.
