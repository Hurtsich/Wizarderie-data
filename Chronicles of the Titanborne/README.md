## Campaign Description

Civilization isn't built on land, but upon the colossal, slowly wandering backs of continent-sized, ancient creatures known as Titans. Each Titan hosts unique ecosystems, cultures, and resources, making travel between them by precarious sky-ship or perilous climb a necessity for trade, war, and survival as the Titans themselves sometimes stir.

## Campaign Theme

Civilization thrives on the backs of colossal, wandering Titans. Sky-ships connect unique cultures across these living continents, amidst precarious travel, scarce resources, ancient mysteries, and the ever-present threat of a stirring Titan.
