# Echoes in the Stone

**Type:** Main Quest

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 sessions

**Description:** Following leads from the initial tremors or Cartel activities, evidence points towards a major, hidden Cartel excavation deep within Terramach's shell, targeting something beyond simple Scale Shards. Elder Rowan Stonehand of the Keepers expresses grave concern.

**Prerequisites:**
- The Collapsed Shaft OR The Stoneleaf Dispute
- Awareness of Cartel activity

## Objectives

### Locate the Hidden Excavation

Infiltrate Cartel-controlled mine sections or explore newly opened fissures to find the secret dig site. Avoid or overcome Cartel patrols and defenses.

**Success Conditions:**
- Discover the location of the main excavation.
- Bypass or neutralize Cartel security measures without raising a full alarm.
- Identify the primary target of the excavation (e.g., ancient structure, Titanblood vein).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Being detected and forced to retreat.
- Unable to find the site.
- Triggering a cave-in or alerting major Cartel forces (like Corvus Blackwood).

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Find evidence the excavation disturbed something dangerous (creatures, energy fields).
- Intercept Cartel communications revealing their specific target.

### Assess the Target and Threat

Once at the site, investigate what the Cartel is truly after and assess the potential danger its excavation poses to Terramach's stability or the surrounding environment.

**Success Conditions:**
- Identify the nature of the excavation target (First Kin ruin, Resonant Crystal deposit, Titan nerve cluster).
- Gather evidence of potential dangers (structural instability, energy leaks, Titan response).
- Report findings to allies (Keepers, Sky-Guard).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Unable to understand the target's nature or significance.
- Being discovered and captured/driven off before assessment is complete.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover the target holds immense power, tempting the players.
- Realize the Keepers might also want the target, but for different reasons.
- Encounter unusual Titan fauna attracted or disturbed by the digging.
