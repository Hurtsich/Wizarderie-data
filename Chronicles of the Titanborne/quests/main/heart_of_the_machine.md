# Heart of the Machine

**Type:** Main Quest

**Difficulty:** Very High

**Estimated Duration:** 4-6 sessions

**Description:** The Geode City Technocracy, under Master Artificer Kellan Geodeheart, is finalizing a powerful weapon or control system derived from Soul-Stone Resonance, potentially hidden within the Logic Spire or near the Crystalized Heart Chamber on Crystalis. This technology threatens to destabilize Crystalis or be used for planetary domination.

**Prerequisites:**
- Completed Arc 3, Section 1
- Information pointing to Technocracy superweapon/device

## Objectives

### Infiltrate the Logic Spire / Heart Chamber Access

Bypass Crystalis's defenses and the Technocracy's security within Geode City to reach Kellan Geodeheart's primary research lab or the control center for his device.

**Success Conditions:**
- Reach the target location undetected or by overcoming security.
- Gain access to the device's control systems or power source.
- Avoid triggering catastrophic defenses.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Being detected and locked down/captured.
- Unable to bypass security measures.
- Triggering a destructive purge sequence.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Find evidence Geodeheart is losing control of the device.
- Discover the device requires a constant feed from Crystalis's core.
- Obtain blueprints or command codes.

### Confront Master Artificer Kellan Geodeheart

Face Kellan Geodeheart. Attempt to reason with him, sabotage his work, or engage him directly. His logic may be flawed, or he may be augmented/protected by his technology.

**Success Conditions:**
- Convince Geodeheart to halt his project (unlikely).
- Defeat Geodeheart in combat or outsmart him.
- Gain control over the device's shutdown mechanism.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Players defeated or captured by Geodeheart.
- Geodeheart successfully activates the device before being stopped.
- Unable to reason with or defeat him.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Geodeheart reveals a surprising justification or external threat motivating him.
- He attempts to integrate the players' minds into his system.
- His defeat causes the device to become unstable.

### Disable or Control the Resonance Device

Based on the confrontation and infiltration, attempt to safely disable the Soul-Stone device, destroy it, or potentially seize control for a different purpose (risky).

**Success Conditions:**
- Device is rendered inert safely.
- Device is destroyed, preventing its use.
- Players manage to control the device's power (potentially dangerous).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Disabling sequence fails, causing overload/explosion.
- Device activates with unintended consequences.
- Control attempt backfires, harming players or Crystalis.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Disabling the device requires a sacrifice.
- Controlling the device reveals truths about Soul-Stone Resonance or Titan consciousness.
- Destroying it causes a backlash that damages Crystalis.
