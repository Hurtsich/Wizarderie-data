# The Caldera's Fury

**Type:** Main Quest

**Difficulty:** High

**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 sessions

**Description:** Ignis Shell the Caldera Heart is experiencing unprecedented volcanic activity, threatening Caldera Hub and vital geothermal extraction. Urgent messages indicate the Caldera Combine's aggressive siphoning might be provoking the Titan, or perhaps hiding a technological escalation.

**Prerequisites:**
- Completed Arc 2
- Received urgent summons/intel about Ignis Shell

## Objectives

### Reach Caldera Hub Amidst Chaos

Navigate the hazardous skies around Ignis Shell, dealing with ash clouds, lava flows, and potential Combine patrols enforcing a blockade. Secure safe landing in or near Caldera Hub.

**Success Conditions:**
- Safely land on Ignis Shell.
- Bypass or negotiate passage through any Combine blockades.
- Arrive at Caldera Hub with skyship relatively intact.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Skyship destroyed or forced to turn back.
- Captured by Combine patrols.
- Unable to find safe landing zone due to eruptions.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Witness massive eruptions changing the landscape.
- Intercept Combine communications about the crisis.
- Find refugees fleeing Caldera Hub.

### Investigate Combine Headquarters / Geothermal Power Core

Infiltrate the Combine HQ or the heavily guarded Geothermal Power Core to determine the true cause of the instability: reckless energy extraction, a failing system, deliberate provocation, or a secret weapon test.

**Success Conditions:**
- Gain access to restricted areas.
- Find evidence (logs, schematics, witnesses like Seraphina Calderkin) revealing the truth.
- Identify key Combine personnel responsible (like a ruthless Vent Master).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Unable to infiltrate target locations.
- Evidence is destroyed or inaccessible.
- Alerting high-level Combine security and being forced to fight/flee.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover the Combine is trying to control Ignis Shell's eruptions.
- Find evidence they are testing a weapon powered by the Titan's core.
- Learn the instability is attracting dangerous fire-elemental creatures.
