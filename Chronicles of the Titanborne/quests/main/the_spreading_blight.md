# The Spreading Blight

**Type:** Main Quest

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 sessions

**Description:** Upon arriving near Verdant Scale (e.g., at Canopy City or a Rootwalker Glade outpost), players learn of a worrying ecological issue: patches of jungle are succumbing to Scale Rot Disease, causing plants to decay unnaturally fast. Faelan Deeproot seeks aid.

**Prerequisites:**
- Completed Arc 1
- Travelled to or near Verdant Scale

## Objectives

### Investigate Blighted Zones

- Unable to find a clear pattern or origin.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover the blight affects fauna as well.
- Find evidence the blight is artificial or being deliberately spread.

**Success Conditions:**
- Gain information about historical outbreaks or similar blights.
