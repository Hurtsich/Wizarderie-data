# The Titan's Pulse

**Type:** Main Quest

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Estimated Duration:** 2-4 sessions

**Description:** The tremors and disturbances have revealed passages leading into what might be the Deep Core Catacombs, far deeper than typical mines. Strange energy fluctuations and unsettling biological phenomena worry the Keepers, who believe Terramach's health is failing.

**Prerequisites:**
- Awareness of Titan instability
- Contact with Keepers of the Titan's Slumber

## Objectives

### Explore the Deep Core Passage

Venture into the newly accessible passage leading towards Terramach's Deep Core. Navigate hazardous terrain, strange atmospheric conditions, and potentially hostile native life.

**Success Conditions:**
- Successfully navigate a significant portion of the passage.
- Document environmental hazards and encountered creatures.
- Survive the journey.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Becoming lost or trapped.
- Being overcome by environmental hazards or creatures.
- Forced to turn back due to insurmountable obstacles.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover a breathtakingly alien ecosystem.
- Find remnants of previous, failed expeditions.
- Map a safe route through a section.

### Investigate the Energy Fluctuations

Locate the source of the unusual energy readings reported by the Keepers. This might involve reaching a Titan 'nerve cluster', a Titanblood geyser, or an ancient internal structure.

**Success Conditions:**
- Pinpoint the source of the fluctuations.
- Gather data or readings on the energy.
- Determine if the fluctuations are natural, caused by external factors (Cartel?), or a sign of Titan distress.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Unable to locate the source.
- Equipment failure preventing data gathering.
- Source proves too dangerous to approach.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover the energy source has consciousness or reacts to presence.
- Find evidence the energy is linked to the 'Titan's Song'.
- Learn the fluctuations are directly impacting surface tremors.

### Assess Terramach's Condition

Based on observations in the deep passage (e.g., purity of Titanblood, health of native flora/fauna, extent of 'Scale Rot Disease'), make an assessment of Terramach's overall health.

**Success Conditions:**
- Gather sufficient evidence (samples, observations) to form a conclusion.
- Report findings accurately to Elder Rowan Stonehand.
- Provide evidence supporting the assessment.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Observations are inconclusive.
- Unable to gather sufficient evidence.
- Misinterpret the signs.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover a specific 'infection' or 'wound' deep within the Titan.
- Find evidence suggesting the condition is chronic, not acute.
- Learn that the Titan is actively trying to heal itself.
