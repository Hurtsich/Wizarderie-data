# Whispers on the Windreach

**Type:** Main Quest

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 sessions

**Description:** Arriving at Windreach Port on a different Titan (e.g., Verdant Scale perimeter or stable Terramach edge), the players witness the bustling sky-trade firsthand. However, rumors abound of Windreach Trading Company ships vanishing without a trace on routes towards Aquilon.

**Prerequisites:**
- Completed Arc 1
- Access to Skyship Travel

## Objectives

### Investigate the Disappearances

- Gain access to relevant Company or Sky-Chartographer Guild records.

**Failure Conditions:**

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Find evidence pointing towards pirates (Sky-Sharks).
- Discover clues suggesting environmental hazards (rogue Aetherium currents, strange atmospheric fauna).
- Hear whispers of 'ghost ships'.

### Trace a Missing Vessel's Path

Based on findings, attempt to follow the last known route of one of the missing ships, possibly requiring hiring a pilot or skyship.

**Success Conditions:**
- Reach the likely area of disappearance.

- Unable to secure transport.
- Route proves too dangerous to follow.
- Find no trace of the vessel.
