# Wrath of the Ancients

**Type:** Main Quest

**Difficulty:** Very High

**Estimated Duration:** 4-7 sessions

**Description:** The culmination of disturbances or a failed ritual (like Vanya's) has pushed a Titan (Terramach, Verdant Scale, or another) past its breaking point. It is stirring fully, threatening Groundfall, collision, or unleashing devastating Titan-Wrath. Players must intervene at the Titan's 'heart' or core consciousness focal point.

**Prerequisites:**
- Completed Arc 3, Section 1
- Major Titan instability event occurred

## Objectives

### Reach the Titan's Core/Focal Point

Journey deep within the stirring Titan, navigating shifting internal landscapes, extreme environmental hazards, and potentially hostile biological defenses or psychic phenomena.

**Success Conditions:**
- Successfully reach the designated core location (e.g., Great Resonance Chamber, Crystalized Heart Chamber, Deep Core Geyser).
- Survive the internal journey.
- Bypass or overcome Titan defenses.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Becoming lost or destroyed within the Titan.
- Unable to overcome internal hazards or defenses.
- Titan shifts making the core inaccessible.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover the 'core' is more metaphysical than physical.
- Find evidence the Titan is reacting to an external stimulus or internal 'parasite'.
- Receive cryptic psychic messages from the Titan during the journey.

### Confront the Source of Wrath/Instability

At the core, confront the entity or phenomenon causing the Titan's distress. This could be a physical manifestation of Titan pain, a parasitic creature, remnants of a failed ritual (Vanya?), or even a direct interface with the Titan's consciousness.

**Success Conditions:**
- Identify the true source of the Titan's rage/instability.
- Engage the source (combat, ritual, psychic communication).
- Survive the confrontation.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Unable to identify or reach the source.
- Overwhelmed by the source's power or Titan defenses.
- Actions taken inadvertently worsen the Titan's state.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover the source is sympathetic or acting defensively.
- Learn the Titan requires a specific action or sacrifice to be calmed.
- Realize the Titan is trying to communicate a warning about a greater threat.

### Calm or Redirect the Titan

Attempt to soothe the Titan's rage, heal its 'wound', complete/reverse a ritual, or redirect its attention/path to prevent catastrophe. May require knowledge gained previously (Titan's Song, Keeper rituals, First Kin tech).

**Success Conditions:**
- Titan's destructive activity ceases or reduces significantly.
- Immediate threat of Groundfall/collision/Wrath is averted.
- A new state of balance (even if temporary) is achieved.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Attempts to calm the Titan fail or provoke it further.
- Catastrophe occurs despite players' efforts.
- Players unable to find a viable method.
- Method requires unacceptable sacrifice.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Titan enters a new dormant state but is permanently changed.
- Players establish a temporary psychic link or understanding.
- Calming the Titan requires containing or imprisoning the source of its pain.
- The Titan is calmed but another threat is revealed.
