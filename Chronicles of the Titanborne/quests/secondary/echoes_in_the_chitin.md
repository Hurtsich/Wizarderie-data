# Echoes in the Chitin

**Type:** Side Quest

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Estimated Duration:** Medium (2-3 sessions)

**Description:** Rumors persist among Deep Miners of strange noises and disappearances in an abandoned section of the Chitin Hive Warrens, recently connected to the main Deep Chitin Mines by tremors. Quinn Quarryfall or another miner asks for help investigating, fearing Scale Worm resurgence or something worse.

**Prerequisites:**
- Access to Terramach's Deep Chitin Mines.
- Good climbing/spelunking gear, combat readiness.

## Objectives

### Navigate Abandoned Warrens

Enter the dangerous, unstable Chitin Hive Warrens section through the mine connection and explore, dealing with natural hazards, potential Scale Worm remnants, and disorienting tunnels.

**Success Conditions:**
- Successfully navigate the warrens without getting permanently lost.
- Reach the areas where noises/disappearances were reported.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Becoming trapped by collapses.
- Being overwhelmed by environmental hazards (gas pockets, secreted traps).
- Getting lost indefinitely.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover unusual fungal growths or bioluminescent phenomena.
- Find passages leading even deeper towards the Titan's shell.

### Investigate Disturbances

Search for the source of the strange noises and the fate of any missing miners.

**Success Conditions:**
- Identify the source of the noises (Scale Worms, other creatures, geological activity, ancient machinery?).
- Find evidence explaining the disappearances.
- Locate any survivors.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Being attacked and overwhelmed by the source.

- Triggering a larger threat.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover a nest of juvenile Scale Worms.
- Find remnants of First Kin technology or structures.

### Report or Resolve

Return to the Deep Chitin Mines and report findings. If a specific threat was identified, take steps to neutralize it or seal off the dangerous area.

**Success Conditions:**
- Return safely with conclusive information.
- Neutralize immediate threats or secure the area.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Being unable to return.
- Leading the threat back into the main mines.
- Failing to resolve the immediate danger.
