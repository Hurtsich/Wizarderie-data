# Silencing the Screaming Stone

**Type:** Faction Quest

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Estimated Duration:** Medium (2-3 sessions)

**Description:** A radical Keeper cell, possibly linked to Vanya Deeproot, plans to sabotage a major Caldera Combine deep drilling operation on Ignis Shell, believing it's causing the Titan immense pain (the 'Screaming Stone'). They need deniable assets to cause a catastrophic 'accident'.

**Prerequisites:**
- Contact with Keeper radicals or reputation indicating opposition to the Combine.
- Access to Ignis Shell.
- Willingness to undertake risky sabotage.

## Objectives

### Infiltrate the Drill Site

Reach the heavily guarded Combine deep drilling operation, likely located near the Molten Veins or a major Geothermal Vent.

**Success Conditions:**
- Reach the site perimeter undetected.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Being spotted by Combine patrols or automated defenses.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Find an alternative approach through lava tubes or vent tunnels.

### Identify Sabotage Point

Locate the critical component or system targeted for sabotage, as instructed by the Keepers (e.g., drill coolant system, power conduit, structural support).

**Success Conditions:**
- Identify the correct target.
- Assess potential collateral damage and escape routes.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Misidentifying the target.
- Being unable to access the target area.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover the drill has already hit something unusual (Titan nerve, ancient structure).
- Find evidence the Keepers' information is flawed or manipulated.

### Execute Sabotage

Plant explosives or trigger a malfunction designed to cause catastrophic failure of the drilling operation, ideally appearing as an accident.

**Success Conditions:**
- Sabotage successfully executed.
- Drilling operation halted or destroyed.
- Escape before the main 'accident' occurs.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Sabotage fails or is detected prematurely.
- Being caught in the explosion/collapse.
- Leaving evidence linking the act to the players or Keepers.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- The sabotage has unforeseen consequences on the Titan's stability.
- Combine forces retaliate fiercely against local Calderkin or suspected Keeper sympathizers.
