**Prerequisites:**

- Currents washing away clues.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Find evidence suggesting the diver went deeper than planned.

### Track the Diver or Cause

Follow any discovered tracks or clues, potentially leading into dangerous coral caves, deeper waters, or towards a predator's lair.

- Determine the cause of the disappearance (predator, accident, ancient trap, abduction?).
- Find the diver (alive or deceased).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Losing the trail.
- Being overwhelmed by underwater hazards or creatures.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover the diver was captured by amphibious humanoids or pirates.
- Find the diver trapped in a section of the mythical Sunken City of Ys.

### Resolve the Situation

Rescue the diver if possible, recover their body, or deal with the threat responsible for their disappearance.

**Success Conditions:**
- Diver rescued or fate confirmed.
- Threat neutralized (if applicable).
- Return to Brinewatch Post.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Failing to rescue the diver.
- Being unable to confirm their fate.
