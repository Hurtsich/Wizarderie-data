# Unstable Frequencies

**Type:** Side Quest

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Estimated Duration:** Medium (2-3 sessions)

**Description:** Technocracy sensors in Geode City have detected dangerous energy fluctuations emanating from a quarantined research lab in the Crystal Forests. The pulses risk causing a cascade failure in nearby crystal tech. Investigate the lab and stabilize the source.

**Prerequisites:**
- Access to Crystalis.
- Ability to deal with energy hazards/constructs.

## Objectives

### Locate Quarantined Lab

Navigate the shifting Crystal Forests to find the sealed and likely hazardous research laboratory.

**Success Conditions:**
- Find the lab entrance.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Getting lost in the Crystal Forests.
- Being harmed by natural crystal resonance fields.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover signs of conflict or hasty evacuation around the lab.
- Find warnings left by the original research team.

### Bypass Quarantine Seals

Find a way into the lab, bypassing or disabling the quarantine measures.

**Success Conditions:**
- Gain entry to the laboratory interior.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Triggering automated defenses.
- Being unable to breach the seals.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Find research logs detailing the experiment and the quarantine reason.
- Find a hidden maintenance entrance.

### Identify and Stabilize Energy Source

Explore the lab, potentially dealing with malfunctioning experiments, energy elementals, or crystal anomalies, to find the source of the dangerous fluctuations and shut it down or stabilize it.

**Success Conditions:**
- Locate the unstable energy source (e.g., experimental crystal core, containment breach).
- Successfully implement stabilization procedures or shut down the device.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Being overwhelmed by hazards inside the lab.
- Accidentally triggering a larger energy release.
- Failing to understand the stabilization process.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover the experiment involved Soul-Stone Resonance.
- Find surviving researchers or hostile crystalline entities.
- Recover valuable (and dangerous) research data.
