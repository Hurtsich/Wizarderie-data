# Titanshore: Chronicles of the Wandering Continents Character Creation Guide

A FATE-based character creation system for a campaign set on the backs of colossal, wandering creatures known as Titans. Players navigate unique ecosystems, interact with diverse cultures, travel via sky-ship, and survive the unpredictable nature of their living world.

## Character Creation Steps

### High Concept

Summarizes who your character is at their core â€“ their occupation, species, or defining role. It's the first aspect you choose and should be instantly evocative.

**Examples:**
- Sky-Ship Captain of the 'Wandering Star'
- Exiled Cartographer from the Spine Titan
- Titan-Worshipping Mystic
- Grizzled Sky-Miner with Debts
- Aethelburg Sky-Guard Deserter
- Scholar Obsessed with Ancient Titan Tech

**Tips:**
- Think about your character's primary function in the world.
- Make it broad enough to be versatile, specific enough to be interesting.
- Consider how it relates to the Titanshore setting (Titans, sky-ships, cultures).
- This aspect should be easy to invoke for common actions related to the concept.

**Requirements:**
- Choose one phrase as your High Concept aspect.

### Trouble

Represents a recurring problem, flaw, or complication in your character's life. It's something that makes things interesting and drives conflict, often providing opportunities for compels.

**Examples:**
- Hunted by Sky Pirates
- 'Borrowing' is Easier than Buying
- Crippling Fear of Falling
- Secret Sympathizer for the 'Earthbound' Cult
- Loyal to a Corrupt Guildmaster
- Addicted to Rare Titan Pollen

**Tips:**
- Choose something that creates interesting situations, not just a weakness.
- It could be an external enemy, an internal flaw, or a problematic connection.
- Think about how this Trouble complicates your High Concept.
- This aspect is the primary target for compels from the GM or yourself.

**Requirements:**
- Choose one phrase as your Trouble aspect.

### Background Phase (Shared Story 1)

Describe an early significant event or relationship that shaped your character. During character creation, you'll link this story to another player character (PC), creating an aspect reflecting your shared past or how that event connects you.

**Examples:**
- We Survived the Same Sky-Ship Wreck
- I Owe Them My Life After a Cave-In
- Apprenticed Under the Same Grumpy Titan Scholar
- Rivals in the Sky-Guard Academy
- Grew Up in the Same Floating Market Slum

**Tips:**
- Work with another player to define this shared moment.
- The resulting aspect should reflect the connection or the event's impact.
- Focus on how this event introduced you to the wider world of Titanshore.
- This aspect often relates to skills like Lore, Contacts, or specific Survival types.

**Requirements:**
- Write a short story (1-2 sentences) involving another PC.
- Derive one aspect from this story.
- This aspect can optionally name the other PC involved.

### Rising Conflict Phase (Shared Story 2)

Detail a more recent adventure or conflict where your path crossed with another PC (can be the same or different from Phase 1). This story should involve higher stakes and create another aspect reflecting the experience or relationship.

**Examples:**
- Framed for a Heist We Pulled Off Together
- Fought Back-to-Back Against Titan Predators
- Competed for the Same Ancient Tech Artifact
- Escaped Captivity from a Sky-Lord's Citadel
- Helped Them Smuggle Forbidden Texts Off the Knowledge Titan

**Tips:**
- Collaborate with another player.
- This story should ideally highlight some of your character's skills or emerging stunts.
- The aspect should reflect a more active or complex part of your history.
- Consider how this event relates to your High Concept or Trouble.

**Requirements:**
- Write a short story (1-2 sentences) involving another PC.
- Derive one aspect from this story.
- This aspect can optionally name the other PC involved.

### First Adventure Phase (Shared Story 3)

Describe the event that brought the entire group together for the current campaign. This story involves all (or most) PCs and sets the stage for the starting situation. It provides the final character aspect.

**Examples:**
- Hired for the Same Dangerous Expedition
- Sole Survivors of the 'Titan's Tear' Incident
- All Indebted to the Same Mysterious Patron
- Witnessed Something We Shouldn't Have in Port Azure
- Bound Together by a Prophecy Found in Titan Ruins

**Tips:**
- This story is often defined collaboratively by the whole group and the GM.
- The resulting aspect should tie you firmly to the starting scenario or the group.
- It might reflect a shared goal, a common enemy, or a significant event.
- This aspect helps explain why your diverse group is working together now.

**Requirements:**
- Participate in defining the group's first adventure.
- Derive one aspect related to this adventure or the group's formation.

## Campaign Guidelines

**Skill Cap:** 4

**Refresh Cap:** 3

**Aspect Guidelines:**
- Characters start with 5 aspects: High Concept, Trouble, and three aspects derived from the shared background/conflict/adventure phases.
- Aspects can be invoked by spending a Fate Point for a +2 bonus or a reroll.
- Aspects can be compelled by the GM (or player) by offering a Fate Point to introduce a complication related to the aspect. Refusing a compel costs a Fate Point.
- Create Advantage actions can discover existing aspects or create new Situation Aspects on characters or the scene.
- Success with Style on Create Advantage grants two free invokes on the aspect instead of one.
- Free invokes can be used like Fate Point invokes but cost nothing and are tied to the specific aspect.
- Sky-ships often have their own aspects (e.g., 'Clunky but Tough', 'State-of-the-Art Sensor Suite').
- Titans themselves might have aspects reflecting their mood or state (e.g., 'Grumbling Slumber', 'Shedding Outer Hide').
