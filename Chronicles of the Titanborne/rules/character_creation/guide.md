# Titans of Aethel Character Creation Guide

A FATE Core character creation system for a campaign set upon the colossal, wandering backs of continent-sized creatures known as Titans. Players navigate unique ecosystems, interact with diverse cultures shaped by their Titan home, travel between Titans via sky-ship or perilous climbs, and contend with the dangers of the living worlds and the mysteries of the Titans themselves.

## Character Creation Steps

### High Concept

A phrase summarizing who your character is at their core, touching upon their role, origin, or primary identity in the world of Aethel. It should be evocative and immediately tell us something important.

**Examples:**
- Sky-Captain of the Rusty Rivet
- Crystal Titan Shard Scholar
- Chitin Nomad Path-Finder
- Disgraced Spire City Guard
- Wandering Titan-Bone Carver

**Tips:**
- Combine your primary role/job with a significant detail, like your origin Titan or a key descriptor.
- Make it something you want to embody and explore during play.
- Think about how it can be invoked positively and compelled negatively.

**Narrative Impact:** Establishes the character's primary identity and role within the setting. Provides immediate hooks for interaction and plot.

**Mechanical Impact:** Acts as a core aspect. Can be invoked for bonuses when relevant (usually once per session for free). Can be compelled to introduce complications related to this identity.

**Development Potential:**
- Living up to the concept.
- Challenging or changing the concept.
- Exploring the nuances and responsibilities of the concept.
