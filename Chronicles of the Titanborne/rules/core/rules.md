# Titans of Aethel

A FATE Core adaptation for a campaign set upon the colossal, wandering backs of continent-sized creatures known as Titans. Players navigate unique ecosystems, interact with diverse cultures shaped by their Titan home, travel between Titans via sky-ship or perilous climbs, and contend with the dangers of the living worlds and the mysteries of the Titans themselves.

## Core Mechanics

### Fate Points

Represent narrative influence, luck, and a character's drive. Players spend Fate Points to influence the story in their favor.

**Usage Rules:**
- Players start each session with a refresh rate determined by their stunts.
- Gain Fate Points by accepting compels on aspects.
- Spending is typically declared before the roll, but rerolls happen after.
- Only one Fate Point can be spent per aspect invocation on a single roll, but multiple aspects can be invoked.

**Limitations:**
- Cannot change fundamental truths of the setting or negate major established facts without GM approval.
- Cannot be used to dictate another player character's actions.
- Declaring a story detail must be plausible within the established fiction.
- Titan Resonance use may carry narrative risks (e.g., unwanted attention from the Titan).

**Interactions:**
- Interacts heavily with Aspects (invocation, compels).
- Interacts with Stunts (some require Fate Points to activate).
- Interacts with Consequences (can sometimes be used to mitigate taking them).
- Refreshed at the start of sessions, influenced by the number of stunts.

**Narrative Impact:** Allows players to highlight what's important about their characters, push through adversity, and collaboratively shape the story's details, emphasizing proactive and dramatic choices.

**Balance Considerations:** Refresh rate should be balanced against the frequency of compels and the power level of Fate Point spends. Ensure compels are offered regularly to keep the Fate Point economy flowing. Titan Resonance should be powerful but situational.

**Example:**

Spending a Fate Point to invoke the aspect 'Veteran Sky-Trader' for a +2 bonus when negotiating passage fees.

**Variations:**
- Invoke Aspect: Spend a point for +2 or a reroll by invoking a relevant aspect.
- Power Stunt: Spend a point to activate a powerful stunt's specific effect.
- Declare Story Detail: Spend a point to introduce a plausible, helpful fact into the narrative (e.g., 'Of course there's an old smuggler's cache hidden here!').
- Refuse Compel: Spend a point to avoid the narrative complication suggested by a compel.
- Titan Resonance (Setting Specific): Spend a point to attempt a deeper connection or understanding of the Titan's immediate state or environment, granting a momentary insight or minor cooperative effect from the local biome (GM discretion).

### Aspects

Phrases describing significant details about characters, locations, situations, or objects. They can be invoked for benefit or compelled for complications and Fate Points.

**Usage Rules:**
- Invoked with Fate Points for +2 or reroll.
- Compelled by the GM (or players) to introduce complications, offering a Fate Point.
- Created via Create Advantage action or as Consequences.
- Free invokes gained from Create Advantage or Success with Style.

**Limitations:**
- Must be relevant to the situation to be invoked or compelled.
- Should be double-edged (invokable and compellable).
- Overly broad or narrow aspects can be less effective.
- GM has final say on aspect relevance and compel appropriateness.

**Interactions:**
- Central to the Fate Point economy (invokes spend, compels grant).
- Created and discovered using the Create Advantage action.
- Can be targeted or affected by certain actions or stunts.
- Define character capabilities and narrative truths.

**Narrative Impact:** Drive the story by highlighting key traits, creating opportunities and obstacles, and rewarding players for engaging with their character's dramatic hooks.

**Balance Considerations:** Ensure aspects are descriptive and evocative, offering clear hooks for invocation and compels. Avoid aspects that are purely beneficial or purely detrimental. Regularly introduce and utilize situation aspects to make environments dynamic.

**Example:**

Character Aspect: 'Mistrustful of Low-Landers'; Situation Aspect: 'Precarious Footing on Shifting Chitin'; Titan Aspect: 'The Great Stone Titan Slumbers Fitfully'.

**Variations:**
- Character Aspects: High Concept, Trouble, Titan Origin (e.g., 'Child of the Crystal Peaks'), Relationship, Belief.
- Situation Aspects: Temporary aspects describing the current scene or environment (e.g., 'Howling Wind Shear', 'Dense Spore Cloud', 'Tense Standoff').
- Consequences: Aspects taken to absorb stress (e.g., 'Sprained Climbing Hand', 'Socially Shamed', 'Rattled by the Roar').
- Boosts: Very temporary, free-invokable aspects representing fleeting advantages (e.g., 'Distracted Guard', 'Off-Balance').
- Titan Aspects: Describe the nature or current state of the Titan itself (e.g., 'Rich Bioluminescent Flora', 'Prone to Sudden Tremors', 'Ancient Scars from Sky-Wars').

### Skills

Represent broad areas of competence characters possess. Used with the four action types to overcome challenges.

**Usage Rules:**
- Rated from Average (+1) to Great (+4), or Superb (+5) at higher power levels.
- Added to 4dF roll result to determine outcome against difficulty or opposition.
- Untrained skills may default to Mediocre (+0) or be unusable.
- Skill list should be tailored to the campaign setting.

**Limitations:**
- A skill cannot be used if the narrative context doesn't support it.
- Some complex tasks may require multiple rolls or specific actions.
- Lack of proper tools or knowledge can impose penalties or prevent use.
- GM sets the difficulty based on the task's complexity and circumstances.

**Interactions:**
- Used in conjunction with the four action types.
- Stunts often provide bonuses or special effects related to specific skills.
- Aspects can be invoked to improve skill rolls.
- Opposing skills used in Attack/Defend and contested actions.

**Narrative Impact:** Define what characters are good at, influencing how they approach problems and interact with the world. Skill choice shapes character concept and role.

**Balance Considerations:** Ensure skills have distinct niches but also allow for synergy. Avoid 'god skills' that are useful in almost every situation. The skill list should cover key activities in the setting (e.g., Titan interaction, sky-travel, cultural negotiation). Advancement should allow specialization and broadening.

**Example:**

Using the 'Sky-Sailing' skill to navigate a sky-ship through turbulent weather between Titans.

**Variations:**
- Common Uses: Overcome obstacles, Create Advantages, Attack, Defend.
- Setting-Specific Uses: Using 'Titan Lore' to identify edible flora, using 'Survival (Chitin Desert)' to find water, using 'Craft (Titan Bone)' to repair equipment.
- Combined Uses: Using 'Athletics' to climb while using 'Notice' to spot hazards.
- Knowledge Uses: Using 'Lore (Titan Histories)' to recall ancient treaties, using 'Investigate' to decipher Titan-cult symbols.

### Stunts

Special tricks, techniques, or innate abilities that grant characters unique mechanical benefits or allow them to bend the rules in specific situations, often tied to a skill.

**Usage Rules:**
- Typically provide a benefit related to a specific skill or situation.
- Must be clearly defined and agreed upon with the GM.
- Often limited to 'once per session' or require a Fate Point cost.
- Characters start with a number of free stunts and can gain more through advancement.

**Limitations:**
- Stunts should be specific, not grant broad, passive bonuses.
- Cannot completely negate core rules without careful consideration.
- Rule-breaking stunts should still make narrative sense.
- Overly powerful stunts may need balancing (e.g., adding limitations or Fate Point costs).

**Interactions:**
- Modify or enhance the use of Skills and Actions.
- Can interact with Aspects (e.g., requiring a specific aspect).
- Some cost Fate Points to activate.
- Contribute to character uniqueness and specialization.

**Narrative Impact:** Provide mechanical distinction between characters with similar skills, highlight unique talents and training, and allow for cool, memorable moments that fit the character concept.

**Balance Considerations:** Ensure stunts provide meaningful benefits without overshadowing skills or making other characters feel redundant. Balance the cost (refresh reduction, Fate Point cost) against the benefit. Stunts specific to Titan interaction or sky-faring should be encouraged.

**Example:**

'Titan-Skin Grafter': Once per session, gain Armor:1 against physical harm originating from Titan creatures or environments.

**Variations:**
- Bonus Stunts: Gain a +2 bonus to a specific skill under narrow circumstances (e.g., '+2 to Athletics when climbing Titan chitin').
- Rule-Breaking Stunts: Use a skill for an action it normally can't perform (e.g., 'Intimidating Presence: Use Provoke to create advantages related to fear instead of Rapport').
- Effect Stunts: Add a special effect to an action's success (e.g., 'Disarming Strike: On a successful Fight attack with style, you can disarm the opponent instead of gaining a boost').
- Resource Stunts: Gain extra resources or uses (e.g., 'Well-Stocked Sky-Larder: Gain an extra free invoke on aspects related to supplies once per session').
- Fate Point Powered Stunts: Allow a powerful effect by spending a Fate Point (e.g., 'Echoes of the Titan: Spend a Fate Point to ask the GM one question about the Titan's immediate intentions or condition, answered honestly but perhaps cryptically').

## Resolution System

The core mechanic for determining the outcome of actions where success is uncertain and failure has consequences.

### Dice Mechanics

Roll 4 Fate Dice (4dF), yielding results from -4 to +4. Add the relevant Skill rating. Compare the total to a target Difficulty (passive) or an opposing roll (active).

### Result Ladder
- Terrible: -2
- Poor: -1
- Mediocre: 0
- Average: 1
- Fair: 2
- Good: 3
- Great: 4
- Superb: 5
- Fantastic: 6
- Epic: 7
- Legendary: 8

**Success with Style:** Succeed by 3 or more shifts. Achieve your goal exceptionally well and gain an added benefit (often a Boost or free invoke).

**Success:** Beat the difficulty. Achieve your intended goal.

**Tie:** Meet the difficulty exactly (vs. passive) or match the opponent's roll (vs. active). Succeed at a minor cost, or partial success with a complication.

**Failure:** Result is lower than the difficulty. You fail to achieve your goal, and often face a negative consequence or complication.

**Special Cases:**
- Contests: Multiple characters compete, comparing totals shift by shift.
- Challenges: A series of actions needed to overcome a complex obstacle.
- Full Defense: Forgoing your action to focus entirely on defense, gaining +2 to defend.
- Teamwork: Characters assisting each other, providing bonuses to the leader's roll.

**Narrative Guidelines:**
- Describe outcomes based on the ladder difference (shifts).
- Failure shouldn't stop the story, but introduce complications.
- Ties should present interesting choices ('Do you succeed, but...?').
- Success with Style should feel impactful and rewarding.
- Incorporate environmental aspects and Titan weirdness into descriptions.

**Balance Considerations:** GM sets difficulties based on the ladder, considering circumstances and opposition. Typical passive difficulty is Average (+1) or Fair (+2). Active opposition uses the opponent's skill + 4dF. Ensure a mix of difficulties to challenge players appropriately.

## Conflict Types

### Physical Combat

Resolving violent confrontations involving physical harm, from brawls and sword fights to sky-ship battles.

**Initiative Order:** Typically determined by Notice skill, highest goes first. Groups of NPCs may act on a single initiative slot.

**Available Actions:**
- Overcome (e.g., disarm, trip, navigate hazardous terrain)
- Create Advantage (e.g., feint, take cover, target weakness)
- Attack (e.g., shoot, strike, ram with sky-ship)
- Defend (e.g., dodge, parry, brace for impact)

**Resolution:** Players and GM take turns performing actions. Attacks target the Physical Stress track. Success is usually taking out opponents (stress + consequences) or achieving a specific combat objective.

**Stress Track:** Physical Stress

**Consequences:**
- Mild (-2)
- Moderate (-4)
- Severe (-6)

**Special Rules:**
- Zones are used to manage movement and positioning.
- Weapon Ratings add to stress on hit.
- Armor Ratings reduce stress taken.
- Environmental aspects (e.g., 'High Winds', 'Tremoring Ground') actively influence the fight.
- Sky-ship combat uses ship stats and specific maneuvers.

**Narrative Guidelines:**
- Describe actions vividly, incorporating the environment.
- Emphasize the consequences of attacks.
- Concessions should be offered as a way out before being taken out.
- Focus on objectives beyond just defeating enemies (e.g., escape, protect someone).

**Common Scenarios:**
- Sky-pirate boarding action.
- Defending a settlement from aggressive Titan fauna.
- Duel on a narrow sky-bridge.
- Sky-ship dogfight amidst Titan spires.

**Pacing Guidelines:** Keep turns moving quickly. Use NPC groups to streamline. Introduce complications or changing conditions via compels on situation aspects to maintain tension.

### Social Conflict

Resolving non-violent confrontations like debates, negotiations, interrogations, or swaying public opinion.

**Initiative Order:** Often determined by Rapport or Provoke, or based on narrative context (who initiated the conversation).

**Available Actions:**
- Overcome (e.g., break down arguments, endure pressure, change topic)
- Create Advantage (e.g., discover leverage, impress audience, corner opponent logically)
- Attack (e.g., demoralize, discredit, intimidate)
- Defend (e.g., resist persuasion, maintain composure, deflect arguments)

**Resolution:** Participants use social skills (Rapport, Deceive, Provoke, Empathy, Will) to influence opponents or achieve social goals. Attacks target the Mental Stress track.

**Stress Track:** Mental Stress

**Consequences:**
- Mild (-2)
- Moderate (-4)
- Severe (-6)

**Special Rules:**
- Situation aspects represent the social environment ('Hostile Crowd', 'Formal Diplomatic Setting').
- Character aspects (beliefs, reputations) are crucial.
- Stakes should be clear (e.g., gain alliance, extract information, avoid punishment).
- Being 'taken out' might mean being convinced, shamed, intimidated into submission, or losing standing.

**Narrative Guidelines:**
- Focus on dialogue, body language, and emotional stakes.
- Use Create Advantage to represent building arguments or finding emotional appeals.
- Describe mental 'hits' as loss of composure, faltering arguments, or growing doubt.
- Consequences reflect social or emotional damage ('Publicly Humiliated', 'Crippling Self-Doubt').

**Common Scenarios:**
- Negotiating trade rights with a reclusive Titan culture.
- Debating policy in a council meeting.
- Interrogating a captured spy.
- Winning the favor of a powerful faction leader.

**Pacing Guidelines:** Allow for back-and-forth dialogue. Use compels to represent social gaffes or external pressures. Resolve quickly once one side has a clear advantage or has taken significant consequences.

## Stress Tracks

### Physical Stress

Represents temporary physical harm, fatigue, and injury.

**Boxes:** 3

**Refresh:** Clears after a scene where the character can rest and recover, unless a consequence was taken.

**Consequences:**
- Mild: Absorbs 2 shifts, lasts until overcome or end of next session.
- Moderate: Absorbs 4 shifts, lasts until overcome or end of scenario.
- Severe: Absorbs 6 shifts, lasts until overcome or a major campaign milestone.

### Mental Stress

Represents social pressure, fear, emotional strain, and mental fatigue.

**Boxes:** 3

**Refresh:** Clears after a scene offering respite from mental pressure, unless a consequence was taken.

**Consequences:**
- Mild: Absorbs 2 shifts, lasts until overcome or end of next session.
- Moderate: Absorbs 4 shifts, lasts until overcome or end of scenario.
- Severe: Absorbs 6 shifts, lasts until overcome or a major campaign milestone.

## Aspect System

**Invocation:** Spend a Fate Point on a relevant aspect to gain +2 to a skill roll or reroll all 4 Fate Dice. Must be narratively justified.

**Compels:** GM or player suggests a way an aspect complicates a character's life, fitting the current situation. If accepted, the player gains a Fate Point and the complication occurs. If refused, the player spends a Fate Point.

**Scene Aspects:** Temporary aspects describing the environment, mood, or significant features of a specific scene. Created by GM setup or player actions (Create Advantage). Lasts until the scene ends or they are changed/removed.

**Situation Aspects:** Similar to Scene Aspects but may persist longer or cover a broader situation (e.g., 'Ongoing Sky-Trade War', 'The Titan is Agitated').

**Free Invokes:** Gained from Create Advantage, Success with Style, or specific stunts. Allows invoking an aspect for its bonus (+2 or reroll) without spending a Fate Point. Can be stacked on an aspect.

**Aspect Creation:** Aspects are created during character creation, through taking Consequences, successful Create Advantage actions, or introduced by the GM as Scene/Situation aspects.

**Aspect Types:**
- High Concept: Core identity.
- Trouble: Primary source of complications.
- Phase/Background Aspects: From character history.
- Situation Aspects: Temporary scene elements.
- Consequences: Represent lasting harm.
- Boosts: Fleeting, single-use aspects.
- Titan Aspects: Describing the Titan itself.
- Gear Aspects: Significant items can have aspects.

**Narrative Guidelines:**
- Make aspects evocative and double-edged.
- Use compels to drive drama and provide Fate Points.
- Encourage players to invoke aspects creatively.
- Use Situation Aspects to make the environment dynamic and interactive.
- Ensure Consequences feel meaningful and impact the character's actions.

**Balance Considerations:** A steady flow of Fate Points via compels is needed to fuel invokes. Avoid making aspects too narrow (rarely usable) or too broad (always usable). Ensure players and GM actively look for opportunities to compel and invoke.

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Forgetting to compel aspects.
- Aspects that are not double-edged (hard to compel).
- Aspects that are too generic or boring.
- Not using Create Advantage to generate new aspects during play.
- Ignoring existing Scene/Situation aspects.

**Advanced Techniques:**
- Tag-teaming aspects: Multiple characters invoking the same aspect for different rolls.
- Layering aspects: Using Create Advantage multiple times to stack free invokes or create synergistic aspects.
- Compelling for decision points: Offering a compel that forces a difficult character choice.
- Aspect-only actions: Resolving simple actions based purely on aspect relevance without a roll (GM discretion).

## Campaign-Specific Rules

### Titan Lore Skill

A specific knowledge skill representing understanding of Titan biology, behavior, ecosystems, history, and related cultural beliefs.

**Requirements:**
- Character concept related to Titan study, survival, or specific Titan culture.

**Effects:**
- Used to Overcome challenges related to Titan environments (e.g., predict tremors, find safe paths).
- Used to Create Advantage by identifying Titan creature weaknesses or environmental features.
- Can be used for specific knowledge rolls about Titan capabilities or history.
- Synergizes with Survival, Craft (Titan Materials), and potentially social skills when dealing with Titan-centric cultures.

**Examples:**
- Rolling Titan Lore to identify if strange fungi are edible or toxic.
- Using Titan Lore to Create Advantage 'Predictable Tremor Pattern' during a climb.
- Recalling legends about the 'Whispering Peaks' Titan's ancient migration route.

### Sky-ship Operation

Rules governing travel and combat using sky-ships.

**Requirements:**
- Access to a sky-ship.
- Characters with relevant skills (e.g., Pilot (Sky-ship), Gunnery, Craft/Engineer).

**Effects:**
- Sky-ships have Aspects (e.g., 'Clunky but Reliable', 'Swift Corsair Vessel'), Stress Tracks (Hull), Consequences, and potentially Stunts/Skills.
- Pilot skill used for maneuvering (Overcome, Create Advantage), targeting solutions (Create Advantage).
- Gunnery skill used for Attacks.
- Craft/Engineer skill used to Overcome damage (repair Hull stress/consequences).
- Travel between Titans requires Pilot rolls, potentially facing environmental hazards (Situation Aspects like 'Storm Front', 'Gravitic Anomaly').

**Examples:**
- Pilot roll to navigate an asteroid field between Titans.
- Gunnery attack targeting an enemy ship's 'Damaged Rudder' aspect.
- Engineer Overcome roll to patch a 'Hull Breach' consequence.

### Titan Environmental Hazards

Mechanics representing the dangers posed by the living Titan environments.

**Requirements:**
- Characters operating in hazardous Titan regions (e.g., deep jungles, high peaks, near vital organs).

**Effects:**
- Often represented by potent Situation Aspects (e.g., 'Toxic Spore Cloud', 'Sudden Chasm Opening', 'Bio-electric Discharge Field').
- May require Overcome rolls (Survival, Athletics, Titan Lore) to navigate safely.
- Failure can result in Physical stress, Consequences, or new negative Situation Aspects.
- Can be compelled frequently, especially during stressful situations.
- Some hazards might target Mental Stress (e.g., 'Disorienting Psychic Hum').

**Examples:**
- Compelling the 'Acid Rain Season' aspect to damage exposed equipment.
- Requiring an Overcome (Athletics) roll vs. Fair (+2) difficulty to cross 'Shifting Chitin Plates'.
- Failing a Survival roll in the 'Luminescent Caves' results in taking Mental Stress due to disorientation.

### Resource Management

Abstract rules for tracking vital supplies like food, water, fuel (for sky-ships), and specialized repair materials.

**Requirements:**
- Situations involving long journeys, survival scenarios, or resource scarcity.

**Effects:**
- Can be handled narratively or using simple Supply Stress Track or Aspects.
- Supply Aspect (e.g., 'Well-Stocked Larder', 'Running Low on Fuel'). Invoked when resources are helpful, compelled when scarcity causes problems.
- Alternatively, a Supply Stress Track takes 'hits' when resources are consumed under pressure or lost. Consequences might be 'Rations Halved', 'No Spare Parts'.
- Skills like Survival, Scavenge, or Craft can be used to Overcome resource shortages or Create Advantages like 'Fresh Water Source Located'.

**Examples:**
- Compelling 'Running Low on Fuel' to force a dangerous landing on an unknown Titan region.
- Invoking 'Well-Stocked Larder' to get a bonus on a social roll by offering rare food.
- Rolling Survival to find supplies, success removes a Supply stress box or improves the Supply Aspect.

### Titan Influence

Represents the subtle or overt effects of the colossal living Titan on its inhabitants.

**Requirements:**
- Characters spending extended time on a Titan, especially in sensitive regions or interacting with strange Titan phenomena.

**Effects:**
- Can manifest as compels on character aspects related to their origin or mental state.
- May introduce temporary Situation Aspects reflecting the Titan's mood or biological processes (e.g., 'Calming Hum', 'Aggressive Pheromones').
- In extreme cases, failure on Willpower (Defend) rolls against Titan influence could inflict Mental Stress or Consequences ('Titan Whispers', 'Symbiotic Urges').
- Certain Stunts ('Titan Resonance') might allow controlled interaction with this influence.
- May grant strange insights or temporary abilities at the cost of complications.

**Examples:**
- Compelling a character's 'Child of the Crystal Peaks' aspect to feel an irrational pull towards a specific location.
- A failed Will roll against 'Maddening Spore Exposure' results in a Mild Mental Consequence like 'Paranoid Delusions'.
- Using a Stunt to briefly tap into the Titan's senses, gaining an Advantage but attracting unwanted attention from its immune system.

### Inter-Titan Relations & Reputation

Tracking how characters and their faction are perceived by the diverse cultures dwelling on different Titans.

**Requirements:**
- Interaction between characters from different Titan origins.
- Actions that have consequences beyond the immediate scene.

**Effects:**
- Can be tracked via Faction Aspects (e.g., 'Allies of the Sky-Traders Guild', 'Mistrusted by the Chitin Nomads').
- Player actions can create or change these aspects.
- Reputation might grant bonuses or impose penalties on social rolls (Rapport, Provoke, Deceive) when dealing with specific groups.
- Significant events can shift reputations dramatically.
- Can influence access to resources, information, or passage rights.

**Examples:**
- Successfully negotiating a fair trade deal improves the 'Sky-Traders Guild Reputation' aspect.
- Being caught smuggling forbidden Titan artifacts applies a negative aspect like 'Known Poacher' with certain conservationist factions.
- Invoking 'Hero of the Spire City Defense' for a bonus when asking for aid from its citizens.
