# Titanshore: Chronicles of the Wandering Continents

A FATE-based rules system for a campaign set on the backs of colossal, wandering creatures known as Titans. Players navigate unique ecosystems, interact with diverse cultures, travel via sky-ship, and survive the unpredictable nature of their living world.

## Core Mechanics

### Fate Points

Represent a character's narrative influence, luck, and determination. Spent to invoke aspects, declare story details, power stunts, or absorb hits.

**Examples:**
- Standard Refresh: Gain Fate Points at the start of each session equal to refresh rate.
- Milestone Refresh: Gain Fate Points only upon reaching minor or major milestones.
- Communal Pool: Players contribute to and draw from a shared pool, encouraging teamwork.
- Titan-Tied Refresh: Refresh rate fluctuates based on the current Titan's mood or environmental stability.

### Aspects

Descriptive phrases representing key elements of characters, equipment, scenes, or the Titans themselves. They can be invoked for bonuses or compelled for complications.

**Examples:**
- High Concept & Trouble: Standard core character aspects.
- Relationship Aspects: Define connections to other PCs or key NPCs.
- Titan-Bond Aspect: Reflects a character's connection or lineage to a specific Titan.
- Sky-Ship Aspect: A shared aspect representing the party's vessel (e.g., 'Rickety but Reliable').

### Skills

Represent broad areas of competence used to perform actions. Ranked in a pyramid or column structure.

**Examples:**
- Standard Skill List: Core FATE skills (Athletics, Notice, Rapport, etc.) with setting adjustments.
- Broad Skills: Fewer, broader skills (e.g., 'Interact', 'Maneuver', 'Know').
- Skill Modes: Skills have different modes for varied application (e.g., 'Fight [Melee]' vs 'Fight [Ranged]').
- Setting-Specific Skills: Adding skills like 'Titan Lore', 'Pilot (Skyship)', 'Survival (Titan Ecology)', 'Ancient Tech'.

### Stunts

Special abilities or tricks that allow characters to bend or break the rules, often by gaining a bonus or special effect in specific circumstances, usually tied to a skill.

**Examples:**
- Skill Bonus Stunts: +2 bonus in specific narrow circumstances.
- Rule Exception Stunts: Allow actions not normally possible (e.g., substitute one skill for another).
- Action Enhancement Stunts: Add extra effects to standard actions (e.g., create an extra free invoke on success with style).
- Titan Attunement Stunts: Stunts that function only on specific Titans or when interacting with Titan flora/fauna.

## Resolution System

## Aspect System

**Invocation:** Spend a Fate Point to gain +2 bonus on a roll or reroll all 4 Fate Dice. Aspect must be relevant.

**Compels:** GM or player offers a Fate Point to make a character's life more complicated based on an aspect. Can be refused by spending a Fate Point.

**Scene Aspects:** Temporary aspects describing the environment, situation, or mood. Can be created, invoked, or compelled.

**Situation Aspects:** Temporary aspects attached to characters, often created by Create Advantage actions (e.g., 'Target Locked', 'Off-Balance').

**Free Invokes:** Gained from Create Advantage or Success with Style. Can be used like Fate Point invokes but cost nothing and are aspect-specific.

**Aspect Creation:** Can be done via Create Advantage, declaring story details (costing a Fate Point), or as outcomes of Overcome/Attack actions.

## Campaign-Specific Rules

- Titan Stirring: GMs should regularly introduce compels or change Scene Aspects based on the Titan's activity level (e.g., 'Rumbling Below', 'Sudden Geyser Eruption', 'Gravitational Shift').

- Sky-Ship as Character: Player crews typically share a sky-ship treated as a character with its own Aspects, Skills (Pilot, Weapons, Hull, Systems), Stress Track, and Stunts.

- Titan Ecology: Survival and Lore skills are crucial. Creating advantages based on understanding local flora/fauna is encouraged. Resources might be aspects ('Rich Crystal Vein', 'Depleted Hunting Grounds').

- Scale Differences: Characters interacting with Titan-scale phenomena face high difficulties or require specific tools/Stunts. Attacks against Titans might focus on creating advantages ('Weakened Joint') rather than direct damage.

- Travel Between Titans: Requires Overcome challenges using Pilot (Skyship) or Athletics (Climbing). Difficulties depend on distance, weather ('Sky Storm'), Titan proximity ('Wake Turbulence'), and political factors ('Airspace Patrolled by X').

- Resource Management: Fuel for sky-ships, rare components for Ancient Tech, and unique biological samples might function as trackable resources or aspects compelling characters towards certain actions.

## Example Scenarios

**Setup:**

The player's ship ('The Wanderer') is in 'Open Sky'. The pirate ship ('The Iron Vulture') approaches quickly.

### Titan Tremor Escape

While exploring ancient ruins on a Titan's flank, a sudden tremor threatens to send the party plummeting.

**Setup:**

The party is on crumbling ledges. The ground is shaking.

**Characters:**
- Player Characters

**Aspects:**
- Scene: 'Unstable Footing'

**Resolution:**

This is a skill challenge. The party must succeed on a certain number of Overcome/Create Advantage actions before the situation escalates too far (e.g., before the GM adds 3 negative Scene Aspects or triggers a major collapse). Failure might mean taking consequences or being separated.

**Lessons:**
- Skill challenges use a series of actions against environmental hazards.
- Scene aspects evolve dynamically.
- Failure can lead to consequences or change the situation rather than ending the story.
