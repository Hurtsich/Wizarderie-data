# Aethelgard: The World Astride Titans

## Description

Aethelgard is a world where life unfolds upon the colossal backs of ancient, wandering Titans. These living continents drift through an endless sky, each hosting unique ecosystems, scarce resources, and distinct civilizations connected by precarious sky-ship routes. Survival depends on understanding the Titans, navigating the Aetherium currents, and contending with rival factions, ancient mysteries, and the ever-present danger of a Titan stirring from its slumber.

## Physical World

The known world consists of colossal Titans wandering through an endless, cloud-filled sky. Between the Titans lies the 'Void Between Worlds,' a dangerous expanse navigated by sky-ships following Aetherium currents.

### Details

Each Titan has unique geography (mountains, plains, oceans, jungles, deserts formed on its shell). Climate varies drastically depending on the Titan's nature (hot Ignis Shell, cold Boreas Spine) and altitude. Weather includes normal rain and wind, plus unique phenomena like Skyshard Storms (crystal fragments falling from Crystalis) and Titan's Wake (atmospheric disturbances following a Titan). Bioluminescent life is common in dark environments.

### Impact

Survival depends entirely on adapting to the specific Titan environment. Travel between Titans is essential but perilous, defining trade, warfare, and cultural exchange.

## Cultural Elements

Diverse cultures have evolved in isolation on different Titans, shaped by their unique environments and histories. However, sky-travel facilitates cultural exchange, conflict, and syncretism.

### Details

Languages vary widely, though a 'Trade Tongue' facilitates communication at major ports. Customs often revolve around the host Titan: Titan Worship, appeasement rituals (Keepers), reverence for navigators (Windriders), respect for nature (Verdant Scale). Art forms include shell carving, crystal sculpting, bioluminescent weaving, and epic poems about sky-voyages and Titan lore. Sky-Sailor culture, with its own superstitions and traditions, is widespread.

### Impact

Cultural identity is strongly tied to one's home Titan, leading to both pride and prejudice. Shared threats and trade foster common ground, but deep cultural divides remain.

## Social Structures

Power dynamics are complex, influenced by control over resources, sky-travel, military strength, and connection to the Titans themselves. Social hierarchies exist within and between Titan societies.

### Details

Leadership varies: elected Councils (Aethelgard Republic), hereditary rulers (Scale Lords), military commands (Sky-Guard Legion), technocratic bodies (Geode City), religious figures (Titan Speakers, Keepers). A distinct class of skilled Sky-Captains and Navigators holds considerable influence. Guilds (Miners, Smiths, Pilots) wield significant power in cities. On some Titans, society is tribal or clan-based. Wealth often determines status, tied to control of rare resources or trade routes.

### Impact

Social mobility can be limited by birth Titan or guild affiliation. Power struggles between factions (Hegemony vs. Cartel, Technocracy vs. Keepers) shape politics. Access to sky-travel often defines the elite.

## Economic Systems

The economy is driven by the scarcity of resources and the necessity of inter-Titan trade via sky-ship. Control over key resources, trade routes, and technology dictates economic power.

### Details

Primary trade involves exchanging unique Titan resources: minerals from Terramach, aquatic goods from Aquilon, energy tech from Ignis Shell, botanicals from Verdant Scale, crystals from Crystalis. Key resources include Titanblood (potent fuel/alchemical ingredient), Scale Shards (durable building material), Sky-Ambergris (valuable compound), various crystals and metals. Currency exists (e.g., Hegemony Credits, Guild Scrip), but barter using valuable resources is common, especially outside major hubs. Major economic players include Trading Companies (Windreach), Resource Cartels (Scale Shard), and Guilds.

### Impact

Wealth is concentrated in trade hubs and resource-rich areas. Skyship Piracy is a constant threat to trade. Economic warfare (e.g., resource manipulation, trade route blockades) is common between factions.

## Everyday Life

Daily life is fundamentally shaped by the environment of the host Titan and the reliance on its stability. Routines, jobs, and leisure activities reflect the unique challenges and opportunities of living on a Titan.

### Details

Common jobs include: Shell Miners, Crystal Harvesters, Vent Tappers, Spore Farmers, Beast Tamers/Hunters, Sky-Pilots, Shipwrights, Chartographers, Guild Artisans, Titan Scholars, Priests/Keepers. Daily routines involve maintaining structures against Titan movement, conserving resources, and monitoring the environment. Hobbies might include carving shell fragments, cultivating bioluminescent fungi, sky-fishing from cliffs, playing complex board games based on Titan movements, or participating in local festivals tied to the Titan's cycles. Shellshock Sickness (anxiety/vertigo from Titan tremors) is a known ailment.

### Impact

Life requires constant adaptation and awareness of the Titan's state. Community cooperation is often essential for survival. Fear of Titan instability underlies everyday existence.
