## Campaign Description
Civilization isn't built on land, but upon the colossal, slowly wandering backs of continent-sized, ancient creatures known as Titans. Each Titan hosts unique ecosystems, cultures, and resources, making travel between them by precarious sky-ship or perilous climb a necessity for trade, war, and survival as the Titans themselves sometimes stir.

## Campaign Theme
Survival, exploration, and conflict in a world built upon colossal, mobile creatures.
