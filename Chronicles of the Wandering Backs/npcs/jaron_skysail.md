## Jaron Skysail - Independent Sky-Captain
**Role:** major ally

**Physical Description:** Man in his late 30s, easy grin, wind-tousled hair. Wears a well-worn Skyfarer's coat over practical clothes. Moves with the confidence of someone comfortable on deck. Has a Sky-Coral charm hanging from his belt.

### Background

- Left the Concord after refusing an order he deemed unethical (e.g., abandoning refugees, aiding Cartel operations).
- Acquired his own small, versatile Sky-Ship, 'The Horizon Seeker'.
- Has navigated treacherous routes others avoid, including trips near Aquilon and Xylos.

**Secrets:**
- Owes money to The Spine Syndicate after a deal went bad.
- Maintains contacts within the Concord who feed him information (and vice versa).
- Secretly dreams of finding a completely unknown, habitable Titan.
- Once accidentally witnessed a clandestine meeting between a Concord official (Vorlag?) and a Black Wind Corsair.

**Hobbies:**
- Playing the flute (badly).
- Charting unexplored air currents.
- Collecting stories and rumors from different Titan ports.

### Additional Information

- Helping those caught in the crossfire of factional conflicts.

**Goals:**
- Keep 'The Horizon Seeker' flying and provisioned.
- Find lucrative (but preferably ethical) cargo runs or charter opportunities.
- Clear his debt with the Spine Syndicate.
- Chart a new, safe passage between two major Titans.

**Connections:**
- The Skyfarer's Concord: Ex-member, cynical view. Still has contacts but avoids official dealings. (Strength: Medium, Type: Former Affiliation/Contacts)
- Linnea Swiftwind: Knew her in the Concord; respects her skill but distrusts her ambition. (Strength: Weak, Type: Acquaintance/Rival)
- The Spine Syndicate: Owes them money, avoids them when possible. (Strength: Medium, Type: Creditor/Enemy)
- The Black Wind Corsairs: Avoids as dangerous hazards, but might have intel on them. (Strength: Weak, Type: Enemy (Indirect))
- Players: Potential clients or allies if they pay well and don't cause too much trouble. Could become loyal friend. (Strength: Variable, Type: Ally/Service Provider)

**Development Potential:** Could become the players' primary mode of transport and a loyal friend. Might be forced to confront his past with the Concord or his debt to the Syndicate. Could sacrifice his independence for a greater cause.
**Reaction to Players:** Initially professional and mercenary ('My ship, my rules, your coin'). Warms up if players show respect for his ship and crew, act ethically, and share his dislike for oppressive factions. Dislikes being treated like a mere taxi service.
