### Additional Information

**Development Potential:** Could potentially be reasoned with if his fear of mortality is exploited, or if shown definitive proof his actions will destroy the resources he craves. Could also double down, becoming even more ruthless if cornered.
**Reaction to Players:** Initially dismissive unless they prove a direct threat or potential asset. Will try to buy, intimidate, or eliminate them if they interfere. May feign cooperation if useful.
