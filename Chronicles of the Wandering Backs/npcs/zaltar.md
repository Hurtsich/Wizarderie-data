## Zaltar - Deep-Seer
**Role:** major antagonist

**Physical Description:** Gaunt figure draped in dark, earth-toned robes adorned with fossilized chitin fragments. Eyes burn with feverish intensity. Often carries a staff topped with a resonating Echo Shard.

### Background
**Origin:** Former Shell-Dweller from Terragon's Gut-Deep Jungles who claims to have heard 'The Deep Rumble' and seen visions within the Titan Parasite Lair.

**Significant Events:**
- Survived a cave-in that killed his family, claiming the Titan's voice guided him out.
- Gathered followers among the desperate and disillusioned, forming the Cult of the Deep Rumble.
- Performed rituals in hidden locations (Ossuary Catacombs, Deep Pore Abyss) claiming to appease or awaken something below.
- Acquired a potent Echo Shard that seems to amplify his connection to Titan vibrations, but also warps his mind.

**Secrets:**
- His 'visions' are heavily influenced/caused by the Echo Shard and potentially a Void Below entity.
- He isn't communicating with the Titans, but something older and more malevolent.
- Secretly directs sabotage against stabilizing influences (Titan Watchers tech, Children of the Great Backs rituals).
- Fears he is losing control to the entity he communes with.

**Hobbies:**
- Meditating in absolute darkness.
- Carving intricate patterns into Titan bone.
- Listening to seismic vibrations.

### Personality
**Traits:**
- Charismatic
- Fanatical
- Obsessed
- Delusional
- Driven
- Mystical

**Values:**
- The Deep Rumble (his entity)
- Destruction of the 'surface parasites' (civilization)
- True Titan Awakening (as he interprets it)
- Obedience from followers

**Fears:**
- Silence
- The Sky-Father Devotees (rival cult)
- Losing his connection/power
- That his entity might abandon him or consume him

**Desires:**
- To fully awaken the entity he worships
- To shatter the current order
- To become the voice of the 'true' Titan will
- To silence the 'false' Titan Song

### Additional Information
**Motivations:**
- Belief that he is enacting a necessary, albeit destructive, purification.
- Driven by perceived commands from his entity.
- Revenge against a world he feels abandoned him.
- Desire for power wielded through faith and fear.

**Goals:**
- Perform a grand ritual to fully manifest his entity or cause a catastrophic Titan event.
- Destroy key symbols/locations of the Hegemony and Children of the Great Backs.
- Convert or eliminate rival interpretations of Titan divinity.
- Spread chaos and fear to 'prepare the way'.

**Connections:**
- Cult of the Deep Rumble: Founder and revered leader. (Strength: Strong, Type: Leader)
- Children of the Great Backs: Views as heretics preaching a false doctrine; actively hostile. (Strength: Strong, Type: Enemy)
- Terragon Hegemony: Sees as the epitome of surface corruption; target for destruction. (Strength: Strong, Type: Enemy)
- Echo Shards: Reliant on for power and communication, potentially addicted or controlled by. (Strength: Strong, Type: Tool/Source)
- The Void Below: Believes he communicates with an entity from here; the true source of his power and madness. (Strength: Strong, Type: Patron (Indirect))

**Development Potential:** Could potentially be 'saved' if the connection to the entity/shard is severed, but his mind is likely shattered. Could become a tragic figure if players learn his origin. Could fully succumb and become a direct vessel for the entity.
**Reaction to Players:** Views them as ignorant surface dwellers. Will attempt to convert them through cryptic prophecies or eliminate them if they interfere with his 'holy work'. Might see powerful players as potential sacrifices.
