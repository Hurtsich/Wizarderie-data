# Main Quests

## Aetherium Jitters
**Type:** Investigation/Exploration
**Difficulty:** Medium-High
**Estimated Duration:** 5 sessions

**Description:** The vital Aetherium fueling Sky-Ships is behaving erratically around Ventus. Titan Watchers like Erion Aethersson suspect a link to the Titan Awakening or something more sinister. Investigate the Aetherium Veinlands and explore links to the nearby Ruins of the Skyborne Citadel.

**Prerequisites:**
- Arrival on Ventus.

### Objectives
#### Objective
Gather data and witness accounts of Aetherium surges or unusual atmospheric phenomena near the Veinlands.

**Success Conditions:**
- Collect sensor readings (perhaps via Erion Aethersson or Elara Skysight).
- Interview Aetherium prospectors and Wind Weavers.
- Document specific anomalies.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Unable to gather reliable data.
- Witnesses uncooperative or phenomena too dangerous to observe closely.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Data points towards the Ruins of the Skyborne Citadel as a source.
- Discover sabotage attempts at Aetherium Refiners Guild facilities.
- Witness strange energy discharges correlating with Titan stress indicators.

#### Objective
Explore the Aetherium Veinlands to find the source or focus of the disturbances.

**Success Conditions:**
- Locate areas of concentrated anomalous activity.
- Identify potential causes (natural resonance, precursor tech interference, faction activity).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Become lost or trapped in the hazardous Veinlands.
- Unable to pinpoint a specific source.
- Driven off by environmental hazards or hostile entities.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover hidden Sky-Iron Cartel test sites.
- Find precursor artifacts reacting to Aetherium surges.
- Encounter strange Aetherium-based life forms.

#### Objective
Investigate potential links to the Ruins of the Skyborne Citadel, possibly by finding a safe approach or observing from a distance.

**Success Conditions:**
- Confirm or deny energy discharges originating from the Ruins.
- Find artifacts or debris near the Ruins exhibiting similar anomalies.
- Potentially find a map or flight plan to approach the Ruins (via Windborne Explorers Society?).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Unable to get close enough for meaningful observation.
- Automated defenses from the Ruins pose too great a threat.
- No clear link established.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Retrieve a functional, minor precursor artifact.
- Detect signals being broadcast from the Ruins.
- Observe Sky-Iron Cartel or Shard Collector activity near the Ruins.
