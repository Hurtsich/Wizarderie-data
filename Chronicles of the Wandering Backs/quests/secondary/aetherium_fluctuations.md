## Aetherium Fluctuations
**Type:** Side Quest (Investigation/Exploration)
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Estimated Duration:** 2 sessions

**Description:** Stellan Cloudwalker, a merchant in Windshear Market, has noticed dangerous fluctuations in local Aetherium stability, affecting Sky-Ship instruments and power. He asks the party to investigate the nearby Aetherium Veinlands to find the source before it causes a major accident or disrupts trade further.

**Prerequisites:**
- Access to Windshear Market
- Means to travel to Aetherium Veinlands (Sky-Ship or dangerous climb)

### Objectives
#### Objective
Travel to the Aetherium Veinlands and locate areas of high fluctuation.

**Success Conditions:**
- Safely reach the Aetherium Veinlands region.
- Use detection tools (provided by Stellan or party-owned) or observe environmental signs to pinpoint affected zones.
- Document the nature of the fluctuations (surges, dead zones, static bursts).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Getting lost or stranded in the Veinlands.
- Equipment malfunctions dangerously due to fluctuations.
- Unable to identify specific zones of instability.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Fluctuations seem linked to specific weather patterns or times.
- Discovering unusual crystalline formations or energy discharges.
- Encountering Titan Watchers or Sky-Iron Cartel teams already investigating.

#### Objective
Investigate the cause of the Aetherium fluctuations.

**Success Conditions:**
- Find evidence of natural causes (e.g., geological shifts, interaction with Ventus storms).
- Find evidence of artificial causes (e.g., experimental Cartel mining tech, precursor artifact activation, sabotage).
- Identify the specific source (a machine, a crystal node, a damaged vein).
- Gather samples or readings if possible.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Cause remains elusive.
- Evidence is destroyed or inaccessible.
- Being driven off by the source (e.g., automated defenses, Cartel security).

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- The fluctuations are linked to the Ruins of the Skyborne Citadel.
- The cause is a previously unknown natural phenomenon of Ventus.
- Multiple factors seem to be contributing to the instability.

#### Objective
Report findings back to Stellan Cloudwalker.

**Success Conditions:**
- Return to Windshear Market.
- Provide Stellan with a clear explanation of the cause and location.
- Suggest potential solutions or warnings for Sky-Sailors.
- Receive payment.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Unable to return or report.
- Report is inaccurate or unhelpful.
- Stellan dismisses the findings.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Deciding to report findings to the Skyfarer's Concord or Titan Watchers instead.
- Attempting to fix the problem directly (if possible and feasible).
- Selling the information to the highest bidder (e.g., Cartel, Hegemony).


### Additional Information
**Key NPCs:**
- Stellan Cloudwalker (Quest Giver, Merchant)
- Potential Sky-Iron Cartel agents (Antagonists)
- Potential Titan Watchers researchers (Neutral/Informants)
- Aetherium-adapted creatures (Antagonists)

**Key Locations:**
- Windshear Market
- Aetherium Veinlands
- Specific crystal formations or mining sites within the Veinlands
- Ruins of the Skyborne Citadel (Potential link)

**Rewards:**
- **Primary Reward:** Payment in currency or rare trade goods from Stellan.
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Discount on goods from Stellan's stall.
  - Aetherium detection device (basic).
  - Good standing with Windshear Market merchants.
  - Raw Aetherium crystals (small amount).
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - Information about Cartel activities on Ventus.
  - Clue related to precursor technology if linked to the Ruins.
  - Stellan becomes a reliable source for market rumors and contacts.
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Windshear Market Merchants Reputation Increase: Seen as helpful problem-solvers by the merchant community. (Faction: Windshear Market Merchants (General), Impact: Positive)
  - The Sky-Iron Cartel Reputation Impact: Potential negative impact if their activities are uncovered. (Faction: The Sky-Iron Cartel, Impact: Negative)

**Branching Paths:**
- The cause is natural, requiring warnings to be issued.
- The cause is Cartel activity, leading to potential confrontation or reporting.
- The cause is precursor tech, leading to further investigation of the Ruins.

**Optional Content:**
- Attempt to stabilize a minor fluctuation source.
- Place warning beacons for Sky-Sailors.
- Map the areas of highest Aetherium instability.
