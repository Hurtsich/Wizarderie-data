## Blocked Pass
**Type:** Guild Quest (Ridge-Runner Messengers)
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Estimated Duration:** 2 sessions

**Description:** Cerys Spinefoot, leader of the Ridge-Runner Messengers, reports that Windhowl Pass, a critical route through the Spinefall Mountains, is blocked by a suspicious rockslide. She needs reliable agents to investigate the cause, assess the stability, and potentially clear the pass.

**Prerequisites:**
- Access to Spinefall Exchange or the Spinefall Mountains region.

### Objectives
#### Objective
Travel to the blocked Windhowl Pass.

**Success Conditions:**
- Navigate the Spinefall Mountains safely.
- Reach the site of the rockslide in Windhowl Pass.
- Assess the immediate dangers (loose rock, potential ambush).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Getting lost or encountering unrelated hazards.
- Being attacked by mountain predators (e.g., Aether Drakes).
- Arriving too late (e.g., pass cleared by others, situation worsened).

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Finding stranded travelers or messengers near the blockage.
- Observing suspicious activity (e.g., Spine Syndicate scouts) near the pass.

#### Objective
Investigate the cause of the rockslide.

**Success Conditions:**
- Examine the rockslide for signs of deliberate action (tool marks, explosives residue).

- Find any witnesses or tracks.
- Determine if the blockage was natural or intentional.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Evidence is inconclusive or buried.
- Misinterpreting the cause.
- Being discovered by those who caused the blockage (if intentional).

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Finding evidence implicating a specific group (Spine Syndicate, Sky-Iron Cartel trying to disrupt rivals, Cultists).
- Discovering the slide exposed something hidden (cave entrance, mineral deposit).

#### Objective
Report findings and potentially clear the pass.

**Success Conditions:**
- Report the cause and stability assessment back to Cerys Spinefoot.
- If feasible and deemed safe, clear a path through the rockslide (may require tools, time, or specialized skills).
- If sabotage is confirmed, provide evidence to Cerys.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Unable to report back.
- Attempting to clear the pass triggers a larger collapse.
- Evidence of sabotage is lost or stolen.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Deciding the pass is too unstable to clear safely.
