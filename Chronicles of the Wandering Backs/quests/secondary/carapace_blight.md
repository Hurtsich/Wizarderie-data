# Secondary Quests

## Carapace Blight
**Type:** Side Quest (Investigation/Retrieval)
**Difficulty:** Easy
**Estimated Duration:** 1-2 sessions

**Description:** Moira Rootwise, Carapace Master of Rootfast Hold, is deeply concerned about a strange blight affecting the crops grown on the Titan Hide. She needs help identifying the cause and finding a cure before it threatens the Hold's food supply.

**Prerequisites:**
- Access to Rootfast Hold

### Objectives
#### Objective
Examine the blighted Carapace Farms.

**Success Conditions:**
- Inspect affected crops and soil (Titan Hide).
- Collect samples of blighted plants and potential contaminants.
- Observe any unusual environmental factors or creature activity nearby.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Contaminating samples.
- Overlooking key symptoms or environmental clues.
- Being attacked by agitated fauna while investigating.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- The blight seems to affect only specific types of crops.
- Finding strange fungal growths alongside the blight.

#### Objective
Seek expert analysis of the blight samples.

**Success Conditions:**
- Consult with Moira Rootwise for traditional knowledge.
- Potentially seek help from a Titan Watchers outpost (if available/accessible).
- If necessary, travel to find an alchemist (like Nessa Quill in Chitinburg, though difficult) or researcher.
- Receive a diagnosis of the blight's cause (fungal, parasitic, chemical, Titan biological reaction).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Unable to find anyone who can analyze the samples.
- Samples degrade before analysis.
- Diagnosis is inconclusive.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- The cause is identified as negligence or poor farming practices, causing friction with Moira.
- The analysis suggests a link to deeper Titan sickness.

#### Objective
Obtain or create a remedy for the blight.

**Success Conditions:**
- Based on the diagnosis, gather necessary components for a cure (e.g., specific herbs, minerals, purified Titan Ichor).
- Successfully craft or obtain the remedy.
- Apply the remedy to the affected farms under Moira's guidance.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Unable to find necessary components.
- Remedy crafting fails or is ineffective.
- Blight spreads further before remedy can be applied.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- The remedy only halts the spread, doesn't cure existing blight.
- The remedy has unexpected side effects on the Titan Hide or local fauna.
- Discovering the 'blight' is actually a new, potentially useful Titan organism.
