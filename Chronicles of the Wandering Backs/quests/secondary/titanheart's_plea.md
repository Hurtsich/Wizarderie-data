**Difficulty:** Medium
**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 sessions

**Description:** Heart-Listener Orla Titanheart senses a focal point of great distress within Terragon, emanating from near the Cartilage Caverns below Rootfast Hold. She asks the party to investigate the source, fearing it could trigger severe Scale-Quakes or indicate a deeper sickness.
