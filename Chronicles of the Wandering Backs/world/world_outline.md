# Chronicles of the Wandering Backs

## Description
An immersive world set upon the colossal backs of continent-sized, ancient creatures known as Titans. Civilizations rise and fall on these slowly wandering behemoths, where unique ecosystems thrive, cultures clash, and survival depends on navigating the perils of inter-Titan travel and the unpredictable movements of the living lands themselves.

## Physical World
The world exists upon the backs of colossal, continent-sized creatures (Titans) wandering through a seemingly endless sky.

### Details
Each Titan possesses unique geography (mountains, plains, forests, volcanoes, oceans, etc., formed on their shells/hides), climate (influenced by altitude, Titan's nature, and atmospheric position), and ecosystems (Mantle Flora, Shell Fauna). Travel occurs via Sky-Ships navigating the 'Cloud Ocean' between Titans or perilous climbs. The ground itself can shift (Scale-Quakes), and the environment can change based on the Titan's health or mood (Biolume Blooms, Sporefalls). Below is the mysterious 'Void Below'.

### Impact
Survival is tied to understanding Titan behavior. Geography is dynamic. Resources are unique to specific Titans. Travel is inherently dangerous. The environment itself is alive.

## Cultural Elements
Cultures are incredibly diverse, shaped by the specific Titan they inhabit and their history of interaction with others.

### Details
Languages vary widely, though a 'Trade Tongue' facilitated by The Skyfarer's Concord exists. Customs often revolve around Titan cycles, resource availability (Carapace Farming techniques, Biolume harvesting rituals), and survival needs (respect for Wind Weavers, reverence for Scale Menders). Traditions might involve Titan Song interpretation (Children of the Great Backs) or honoring those lost during Scale-Quakes or The Great Climb. Art often uses Titan materials like chitin, polished scale, and Sky-Coral.

### Impact
Strong regional identities tied to specific Titans. Customs emphasize resilience, resourcefulness, and awareness of the living world. Religious beliefs are often animistic, focused on the Titans.

## Social Structures
Social structures vary greatly, from hierarchical hegemonies to decentralized collectives and tribal groups.

### Details
On Terragon, the Hegemony enforces a stratified society with Spire Lords/Ladies at the top, merchants and guild members in the middle, and Shell-Dwellers or miners at the bottom. On Ignisaur, respect is based on smithing skill (Ignis Forge). Aquilon might have status tied to navigating skill. Some settlements like Rootfast Hold are governed by councils (Deep Root Council). Guilds (Windwrights Guild, Deep Miners Union) hold significant power in specific sectors. Religious orders (Children of the Great Backs) influence all levels of society.

### Impact
Power dynamics are complex and often contested. Class is often tied to location (altitude, proximity to resources) and profession. Guilds and religious orders provide alternative power structures to formal governments.

## Economic Systems
The economy is driven by inter-Titan trade of specialized resources, facilitated by Sky-Ships and dangerous land routes.

### Details
Key resources include Aetherium (Ventus, for Sky-Ships), Chitin-Steel (Ignisaur, for tools/armor), Sky-Coral (Aquilon, decorative/alchemical), Deepgut Minerals (Terragon/Ignisaur, industrial), Biolume Blooms (Xylos, light/alchemy), and unique foods/materials from each Titan's ecosystem. Trade hubs like Windshear Market and Spinefall Exchange are crucial. Currency often involves barter, precious metals, or standardized ingots controlled by the Inter-Titan Banking Guild. Major corporations (Sky-Iron Cartel) and guilds (Skyfarer's Concord) dominate large sectors.

### Impact
Interdependence between Titans for resources drives trade and conflict. Control of trade routes and resources equals power. Wealth is concentrated in trade hubs and resource-rich areas.

## Everyday Life
Daily life is fundamentally shaped by living on a colossal, moving creature.

### Details
Jobs are often unique: Scale Menders repair Titan hide settlements, Wind Weavers harness air currents, Biolume Harvesters collect light sources, Carapace Farmers cultivate food on the Titan's shell, Sky-Hunters track aerial creatures. Hobbies might include Sky-Coral carving, participating in local Titan Song choirs, or Scale-Quake prediction games. Daily routines are often interrupted by Titan movements (Scale-Quakes, sudden shifts), weather changes (Ventral Storms), or biological events (Sporefalls). Housing is built from available materials like hardened chitin, stone, fungal-wood, or metal alloys.

### Impact
Constant awareness of the environment is necessary for survival. Professions are highly specialized to the Titan environment. Life has an element of unpredictability due to Titan movements.

**Impact:** Established the foundation myths and earliest settlements.
**Significance:** Origin point for civilization on the Titans.

### The Great Migration
A period where populations spread across and between Titans, facilitated by early forms of flight or perilous climbs. This era saw the founding of many ancient settlements and the differentiation of cultures.

**Impact:** Dispersal of population, establishment of diverse cultures, development of early inter-Titan travel.
**Significance:** Shaped the demographic and cultural landscape.

### The Titanomachy
A legendary ancient war, possibly fought between different factions of First People or even involving conflicts that harmed the Titans themselves. Some believe this era led to the creation of The Sundered Titan.

**Impact:** Potential destruction of a Titan, loss of ancient knowledge, creation of ancient battlefields and ruins.
**Significance:** A dark age myth explaining current dangers and lost history.

### Titan Slumber
A long period of relative dormancy and stability among the Titans, allowing civilizations to flourish without major geological upheaval. Most major cities and institutions trace their golden ages to this time.

**Impact:** Allowed for growth of large cities, development of stable trade routes, and cultural exchange.
**Significance:** Considered a 'golden age', setting a benchmark for stability.

### Discovery of Aetherium
The discovery of Floatstone and its refined form, Aetherium, primarily on Ventus. This revolutionized travel and technology, enabling the construction of modern Sky-Ships.

**Impact:** Led to the Sky-Ship era, increased inter-Titan travel and trade, rise of Ventus's importance.
**Significance:** Technological turning point for the world.

### The Great Climb Era
Before widespread Sky-Ships, travel often involved dangerous ascents and descents of Titan limbs or precarious crossings. This era bred hardy Ridgeclimbers and established many Anchor-Towns.

**Impact:** Development of climbing techniques and gear, importance of specific routes (Spine-Ridge Routes), creation of Anchor-Towns.
**Significance:** Highlights the historical dangers of inter-Titan travel.
