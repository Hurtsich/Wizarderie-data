## Overview

The players begin embroiled in local conflicts on one of the Titans, uncovering hints of a larger threat affecting the creatures themselves. As they travel between Titans, they become entangled in the machinations of powerful factions, uncover ancient secrets about the Titans' origins (Corestone Hearts, Titan-Song), and must ultimately make choices that could determine the fate of the 'Living Continents' and their inhabitants.

## Main Arcs

### Arc 1: The Tremors of Kaelen

The players arrive in Ridgeview on the mountainous Titan Kaelen amidst increasing tremors and reports of strange phenomena in the Crystal Vein Mines. They become involved in local disputes, primarily between the dominant Aetherium Consortium and independent miners/concerned locals, while investigating the cause of the instability.

**Progression Path:** Ridgeview -> Crystal Vein Mines -> Aerie -> Investigating remote Corestone Outcrops or Wind Tunnel Pass.

#### Multiple Paths

##### Path

Ally with the Aetherium Consortium: Gain resources and access, but potentially alienate locals and Scale Wardens. Focus on securing Aetherium sources.

**Key Choices:**

- Map of Ossus (Scarred Hide Wastes, key ruins)
- Rules for extreme environments
- NPC stats for antagonists and scavengers
- Details of discovered lore/artifacts

**Success Conditions:**
- Uncovering critical information about Titan life cycles, Corestone Hearts, or the antagonist's plans
- Surviving the perils of Ossus
- Securing a path towards the final confrontation

##### Heart of the Matter

Armed with knowledge, the players must confront the ultimate threat at its source. This might involve infiltrating the Aetherium Consortium's deep-mining operation near a Corestone Heart, disrupting a Keepers of the Stillness ritual meant to trigger the Stillness Plague, or finding a way to communicate with/stabilize a fully awakening Titan.

**Key Events:**
- Infiltrating a heavily guarded faction headquarters or a critical Titan location (e.g., The Titan-Core Access Shaft, The Forgotten Hatchery).
- The final confrontation with the primary antagonist leader (e.g., Consortium CEO Valerius Corestone, High Keeper Zella of the Stillness).
- A moment where the players' actions directly and visibly impact a Titan's state (calming it, injuring it, stabilizing it).

**Player Hooks:**
- The Final Assault: Leading or participating in an attack on the antagonist's stronghold to stop their plan.
  **Motivation:** Saving the world, stopping the villain, fulfilling faction allegiance.
  **Consequences:** Large-scale combat, high stakes, potential for major character moments and sacrifices, direct impact on the ending.
- The Desperate Gambit: Attempting a risky, unconventional plan, like using Titan-Song to communicate, performing a counter-ritual, or sneaking into the heart of the operation.
  **Motivation:** Avoiding bloodshed, using unique knowledge gained, believing direct confrontation is too costly.
  **Consequences:** High chance of failure but potential for unique success, requires creativity and specific resources/knowledge, could lead to unexpected outcomes.
- Race Against Time: The antagonist's plan is nearing completion (e.g., Corestone drill reaching the Heart, Stillness ritual culminating), forcing the players to act quickly.
  **Motivation:** Urgency, preventing imminent catastrophe.
  **Consequences:** Time pressure mechanics, forcing difficult choices, potential for partial success or failure, dramatic tension.

**Mysteries:**
- What is the true nature and function of a Corestone Heart?
  **Clues:**
  - Direct observation (if reached)
  - Analysis of energy signatures
  - Ancient texts deciphered
  - Antagonist's monologue or captured research notes
  **Resolution:** It's the Titan's energy core, vital for life, potentially sentient or programmable, source of immense power but incredibly dangerous to tamper with. May be linked to Titan consciousness or Titan-Song.
- Can Titan-Song be used to control or communicate with Titans effectively?
  **Clues:**
  - Experiments by players or NPCs
  - Success/failure of rituals (Keepers, Root Tenders)
  - Reactions of Titans to specific frequencies or patterns
  - Discovery of ancient devices that amplify/project Titan-Song
  **Resolution:** Yes, but it's incredibly complex and dangerous. Misuse can enrage or injure Titans. True communication might be possible but requires deep understanding or natural affinity, potentially leading to symbiosis rather than control.
- What are the ultimate consequences of the antagonist's plan succeeding?
  **Clues:**
  - Simulations or projections found in antagonist's base
  - Warnings from ancient prophecies or Scale Warden studies
  - Vision granted by a sympathetic Titan or entity
  - Small-scale demonstrations of the power/effect
  **Resolution:** Depends on the antagonist: Consortium might enslave/kill the Titan for resources causing ecological collapse; Keepers might trigger widespread Stillness Plague, effectively ending civilization on the Titan(s); an awakening Titan might rampage uncontrollably.

**Story Beats:**
- The Point of No Return: Players breach the final location and confront the main antagonist(s) and their ultimate plan.
  **Player Choices:**
  - Direct assault
  - Sabotage critical components
  - Attempt to reason with the antagonist
  - Focus on rescuing captives or mitigating damage
  - Use a discovered artifact or Titan-Song
  **Consequences:** Initiates the final battle/challenge, locks in certain ending possibilities, determines the fate of key NPCs.
- The Titan's Response: The players' actions trigger a direct response from the Titan itself (a tremor, a roar, a change in behavior, a pulse of energy, a moment of contact via Titan-Song).
  **Player Choices:**
  - Press the advantage
  - Attempt to soothe the Titan
  - Protect themselves or others from the response
  - Interpret the response as a guide for next actions
  **Consequences:** Dramatically alters the battlefield or situation, provides confirmation of success/failure, potentially injures or aids the players/enemies, solidifies the connection between actions and the living world.

**Difficulty Level:** Very High

**Estimated Duration:** 5-7 sessions (including climax)

**Required Resources:**
- Maps of final locations
- Stats for final boss(es) and elite guards
- Detailed description of the antagonist's plan/device
- Rules for large-scale events or Titan interaction

**Success Conditions:**
- Stopping the primary antagonist's plan
- Making a definitive choice about the future of Titan/civilization interaction
- Surviving the final confrontation

## Key Moments

### Key Moment

The first time the players witness a major Titan tremor or shift from a precarious position (e.g., on a rope bridge, sky-ship dock).

**Impact:** Establishes the scale and inherent danger of the world, emphasizes that the ground itself is alive and potentially hostile.

### Key Moment

Successfully navigating between two Titans for the first time via sky-ship, experiencing The Perilous Crossing and The Sky-Currents.

**Impact:** Opens up the scope of the world, highlights the importance of sky-travel and factions like the Skyfarers' Concord.

### Key Moment

Discovering concrete proof that the Scale Blight or Titan instability is being deliberately caused or manipulated.

**Impact:** Shifts the central conflict from natural disaster/mystery to conspiracy/antagonism, raises the stakes.

### Key Moment

Making first contact with a non-human intelligence related to the Titans (e.g., sentient fungus in Deeproot Hold, hearing Titan-Song, encountering an ancient guardian).

**Impact:** Deepens the mystery of the Titans, challenges player assumptions, introduces new possibilities for interaction.

### Key Moment

Making a decision that significantly helps one major faction while directly harming another (e.g., siding with Consortium halts miner revolt, siding with Wardens shuts down vital mine).

**Impact:** Demonstrates meaningful consequences of player choices, forces difficult decisions, shapes future alliances/enemies.

### Key Moment

Witnessing the power of a Corestone Outcrop or realizing the potential of Corestone Hearts.

**Impact:** Reveals the ultimate source of power and conflict in the setting, presents immense temptation and danger.

### Key Moment

The climax decision: choosing the fate of a Titan or the direction of civilization's relationship with them.

**Impact:** Resolves the central conflict based on player actions and philosophy, determines the campaign's ending.

## Hidden Secrets

### Hidden Secret

The Titans are not native to this plane/reality and arrived during the Echoes of the First Walkers era, possibly fleeing something.

**Significance:** Reframes the entire cosmology and the Titans' purpose, hints at threats beyond the known world.

### Hidden Secret

A small, parasitic Titan is growing hidden on the undercarriage of a larger one (e.g., Veridian), potentially influencing its host.

**Significance:** A hidden biological threat, complicates understanding of Titan biology, potential source of unique resources or dangers.

### Hidden Secret

The 'Keepers of the Stillness' are unknowingly influenced or manipulated by an entity dwelling in the Cloud Sea or deep within a Titan.

**Significance:** Reveals a hidden layer to the antagonists' motives, introduces a potentially greater threat.

### Hidden Secret

Aetherium is not just fuel, but processed Titan 'blood' or bio-energy, and its extraction slowly drains the Titan's life force.

**Significance:** Adds a dark moral cost to sky-travel and technology, vindicates Scale Warden concerns, raises the stakes of Consortium activities.

### Hidden Secret

Certain individuals ('Shell-Forged' or 'Deep Watchers') can develop a natural symbiotic link with a Titan, gaining unique abilities but also becoming vulnerable to its pain/state.

**Significance:** Potential player character path, provides a route for direct Titan interaction/communication, personalizes the stakes of Titan health.

### Hidden Secret

The 'First Walkers' achieved flight not through sky-ships, but by mastering Titan-Song to levitate or command sky-beasts.

**Significance:** Hints at lost, powerful abilities, provides an alternative to Aetherium-based tech, deepens the mystery of Titan-Song.

## Alternative Endings

### Alternative Ending

The Age of Awakening Begins: Players fail to stop the destabilization or choose to allow/encourage it. Titans become much more active, destroying settlements but potentially revealing new lands or resources. Civilization enters a chaotic new era of adaptation and survival against truly awake gods.

**Requirements:** Failing to stop the Aetherium Consortium's reckless exploitation, failing to stop the Keepers' disruptive rituals, or actively choosing to awaken the Titans.

### Alternative Ending

The Enforced Slumber: Players side with radical Keepers of the Stillness or find another way to impose artificial dormancy (perhaps using knowledge from Ossus). The Titans become unnaturally still, stopping tremors but also potentially halting ecological processes. Civilization persists in a stable but potentially stagnant world under the shadow of this enforced sleep.

**Requirements:** Successfully aiding the Keepers of the Stillness, discovering and deploying a method to induce widespread Titan dormancy, prioritizing stability above all else.

### Alternative Ending

A New Symbiosis: Players manage to bridge the gap between a key Titan and civilization (perhaps through Titan-Song mastery or aiding the Scale Wardens/Root Tenders). A fragile balance is struck, where civilization learns to live *with* the Titan, respecting its needs. Resource exploitation is curtailed, but new forms of interaction emerge.

**Requirements:** Successfully using Titan-Song, brokering peace between major factions (Consortium, Wardens, Keepers), finding a cure for the Blight/instability that relies on cooperation with the Titan's systems.

### Alternative Ending

Exodus or Isolation: Recognizing the untenable nature of living on the Titans, players lead an effort to find a new home (exploring Cloud Sea Secrets, seeking the First Walkers' Legacy) or establish heavily fortified, isolated settlements capable of surviving active Titans. Humanity becomes scattered, abandoning the interconnected era.

**Requirements:** Failing to find a stable solution, prioritizing evacuation or fortification, discovering a viable alternative location or survival strategy independent of stable Titan surfaces.
