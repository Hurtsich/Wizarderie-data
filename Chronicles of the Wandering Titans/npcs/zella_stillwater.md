**Fears:**

**Desires:**

- To stop Aetherium exploitation and sky-travel
- To be the savior who prevents Titan-induced apocalypse

### Additional Information

**Motivations:**
- Absolute conviction in her interpretation of Keeper doctrine.
- Trauma from witnessing Titan instability.
- Belief that sapient life is a 'fever' the Titans must be cured of.
- Desire to impose her vision of peace (stillness).

**Goals:**
- Perfect and deploy the Stillness Plague on a large scale.
- Sabotage Aetherium Consortium operations and sky-ship travel.
- Convert or eliminate opposition within the Keepers of the Elder Sleep.
- Find locations or methods to amplify Titan-Song dormancy frequencies.

**Connections:**
- Keepers of the Stillness: Her fanatical followers. (Strength: Control, Type: Leadership)
- The Keepers of the Elder Sleep: The parent organization she despises as weak. (Strength: Hostile, Type: Conflict (Internal))
- Valerius Corestone: Represents the destructive progress she abhors. (Strength: Hostile, Type: Conflict)
- Nadia Stillwater: A relative who may doubt her methods. (Strength: Tense, Type: Familial/Conflict)
- Scale Wardens: Views their attempts to 'manage' Titans as foolish meddling. (Strength: Hostile, Type: Conflict)

**Development Potential:** Extremely difficult to sway due to fanaticism. Might be stopped, or perhaps horrified if confronted with unforeseen consequences of the Plague. Could be betrayed by a disillusioned follower like Nadia.

**Reaction to Players:** Sees them as symptomatic of the 'fever' of activity. Will try to mislead, convert, or eliminate them if they interfere. Might see them as tools if they oppose the Consortium initially.
