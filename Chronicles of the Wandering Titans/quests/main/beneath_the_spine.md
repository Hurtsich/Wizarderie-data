**Type:** Infiltration/Combat/Sabotage

**Difficulty:** Very High

**Estimated Duration:** 5-6 sessions

**Description:** Infiltrate the Aetherium Consortium's heavily guarded deep-mining operation on Kaelen, located near a volatile Corestone Outcrop or the Titan-Core Access Shaft. Stop Valerius Corestone's plan to exploit or control the Titan's heart.

**Prerequisites:**
- Identification of the Consortium's Corestone operation as a major threat.
- Information regarding the location and nature of the operation (e.g., from 'Consortium Concerns' or 'Echoes of the Ancestors').

### Objectives

#### Objective

Infiltrate the Consortium's deep-mining facility.

**Success Conditions:**
- Bypassing outer security layers (Iron Shell Legion patrols, sensors).
- Gaining access to the main excavation site or control center.
- Maintaining stealth or using disguise effectively.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Detection leading to high alert and facility lockdown.
- Being captured or repelled by security forces.
- Inability to find an entry point.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Using knowledge of Kaelen's tunnels (from Borin Cragfoot or Wind Riders) to find unguarded routes.
- Bribing or coercing a disgruntled Consortium employee (Theron Stonehide?) for access codes.
- Causing a diversion to slip past security.

#### Objective

Reach the Corestone Outcrop or Titan-Core Access Shaft control center.

**Success Conditions:**
- Navigating the interior of the facility.
- Overcoming internal security (guards, automated defenses, pressure doors).
- Arriving at the central operational hub where Valerius Corestone or his lead scientists operate.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Getting lost within the facility.
- Being trapped or cornered by security.
- Unable to bypass critical checkpoints.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discovering horrific biological experiments conducted by the Consortium.
- Finding evidence of collaboration with another faction.
- Locating schematics of the drilling equipment or Corestone interface.

#### Objective

Confront Valerius Corestone and/or disable the drilling/extraction equipment.

**Success Conditions:**
- Defeating or capturing Valerius Corestone.
- Sabotaging the primary drilling mechanism or energy source.
- Overriding controls to halt the operation.
- Preventing the Consortium from achieving their goal related to the Corestone.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Valerius escapes.
- The drilling process reaches a critical, irreversible stage.
- Party is defeated or captured.
- Sabotage attempt fails or triggers a catastrophic meltdown/collapse.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Forcing Valerius into a desperate gamble that further endangers the Titan.
- Convincing a key Consortium scientist or Astrid Ironhull to switch sides.
- Using discovered technology to turn the equipment against the Consortium.
- Having to make a choice between stopping the drill or saving captured allies/innocents.

#### Objective

Escape the facility.

**Success Conditions:**
- Party members successfully exfiltrate the facility.
- Avoiding capture by reinforcements.
- Returning to a safe location (Ridgeview, Aerie).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Being trapped during escape.
- Suffering heavy casualties.
- Escape route is cut off.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Escaping with valuable Consortium research data or prototypes.
- Facility collapses or self-destructs during escape.
- Escape triggers a major response from the Consortium across multiple Titans.

### Additional Information

**Key NPCs:**
- Valerius Corestone: Primary antagonist, likely directing operations.
- Astrid Ironhull: Commander of Iron Shell Legion, formidable opponent.
- Theron Stonehide: Potential weak link, source of information, or scapegoat.
- Consortium Scientists: Possess technical knowledge, potential targets or sources of info.
- Borin Cragfoot / Kestrel Windrider: Potential sources of infiltration routes or assistance.

**Key Locations:**
- Kaelen (Living Continent): Titan location.
- Consortium Deep-Mining Facility: Primary dungeon/infiltration site.
- Corestone Outcrop / Titan-Core Access Shaft: The focal point of the operation.
- Ridgeview / Aerie: Staging points or escape destinations.

**Rewards:**
- **Primary Reward:** Aetherium Consortium's Corestone exploitation plan halted.
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Capture or defeat of Valerius Corestone.
  - Valuable Consortium research data, technology, or Aetherium reserves.
  - Acclaim from factions opposing the Consortium (Miners, Scale Wardens, Wind Riders).
  - Weakening of Consortium influence on Kaelen.
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - A functional Corestone shard or energy cell.
  - Control codes for sections of the Iron Shell Legion (if Astrid is dealt with creatively).
  - Evidence leading to hidden Consortium assets elsewhere.
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Consortium Nemesis: Became a primary enemy of the immensely powerful Aetherium Consortium. (Faction: The Aetherium Consortium, Impact: Very Negative)
  - Kaelen's Protectors: Hailed as heroes by those threatened by the Consortium on Kaelen. (Faction: Independent Miners / Wind Rider Legacy / Scale Wardens, Impact: Very Positive)

**Branching Paths:**
- The operation's disruption causes Kaelen to stabilize or destabilize further.
- Valerius escapes, becoming a recurring antagonist seeking revenge.
- Players gain control of dangerous Consortium tech.
- The power vacuum left by the Consortium leads to new conflicts on Kaelen.

**Optional Content:**
- Rescue miners or researchers being held captive in the facility.
- Retrieve specific research data for the Scale Wardens or Mira Driftborn.
- Sabotage secondary Consortium operations within the facility.
