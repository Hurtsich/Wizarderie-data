## Heart of the Rot

**Type:** Exploration/Dungeon Crawl

**Difficulty:** Medium-High

**Estimated Duration:** 4-5 sessions

**Description:** Venture deep into Veridian's Fungal Forest, following clues from Anchorpoint or Scale Warden intelligence, to pinpoint the epicenter of the Scale Blight outbreak and confront whatever or whoever is responsible for its intensity.

**Prerequisites:**
- Completion of 'The Spreading Scourge' or 'The Mire Market Cure'.
- Leads pointing towards the Fungal Forest as the Blight source.

### Objectives

#### Objective

- Party succumbs to environmental hazards.
- Party is forced to turn back due to resource depletion or injury.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discovering hidden groves or ecosystems untouched by the Blight.
- Encountering unique Fungal Forest creatures (hostile or neutral).
- Finding signs of other travelers (Scale Wardens, Root Tenders, antagonists).

#### Objective

Locate the epicenter of the Scale Blight outbreak (e.g., the Blighted Grove Heart).

**Success Conditions:**
- Pinpointing the area with the highest concentration of Blight.
- Identifying unnatural elements at the epicenter (e.g., strange technology, ritual site, specific pollutant).

- Identifying a natural phenomenon being unnaturally amplified.
- Confronting and defeating/capturing agents responsible found at the site.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Cause remains ambiguous.
- Agents escape or destroy evidence before they can be stopped.
- Party misidentifies the cause.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- The cause is revealed to be linked to events on Kaelen.
- Discovering the Blight is a symptom of Veridian itself being 'sick' in a deeper way.

#### Objective

Neutralize or contain the immediate source (if possible).

**Success Conditions:**
- Destroying devices spreading the Blight.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Containing the source alerts a larger force.
- Actions taken have unforeseen ecological side-effects.
- Success provides a temporary reprieve, buying time for a larger solution.
