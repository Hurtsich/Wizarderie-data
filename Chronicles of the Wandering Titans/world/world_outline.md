# Chronicles of the Wandering Titans

## Description

A world built upon the colossal, slowly wandering backs of continent-sized, ancient creatures known as Titans. Each Titan hosts unique ecosystems, cultures, and resources, making travel between them by precarious sky-ship or perilous climb a necessity for trade, war, and survival as the Titans themselves sometimes stir.

## Physical World

The world consists of the 'Living Continents' - colossal, ancient creatures called Titans wandering through an endless sky above a mysterious Cloud Sea. Each Titan is a world unto itself, with unique geography formed from its body.

### Details

Titan surfaces feature mountains (Spine Ridge Mountains), plains (Great Dorsal Plains), forests (Fungal Forest), deserts (Scarred Hide Wastes), lakes (Sunken Scute Lakes), and unique features like crystalline growths or steam vents. The atmosphere is breathable, supporting diverse ecosystems. Weather patterns (Sky-Currents) flow between Titans, crucial for travel. Climate varies drastically between Titans and even different regions on a single Titan.

### Impact

Geography dictates settlement patterns, resource availability, and travel routes. Titan movements (The Great Drift, Molting Cycles) cause constant change and potential hazards. Survival depends on adapting to the specific Titan environment and navigating the Sky-Currents.

## Cultural Elements

Cultures ('Carapace Cultures') are incredibly diverse, shaped by the specific Titan they inhabit and their history of interaction with others. Common threads include reverence (or fear) of the Titans and reliance on sky-travel.

### Details

Languages vary, though a Trade Tongue facilitated by the Pan-Titan Trade Alliance is common in ports. Customs are tied to Titan life: Sky-Burial Rites are common, where the dead are committed to the sky or Cloud Sea. Traditions often involve appeasing the Titan or celebrating its stability (e.g., rituals during Molting Cycles). Art and architecture frequently incorporate Titan materials like chitin, scale, or bone.

### Impact

Cultural identity is strongly tied to one's home Titan. Inter-Titan prejudice and alliances exist. Shared practices like sky-travel create common ground, while unique local customs reinforce differences.

## Social Structures

Social hierarchy is often determined by proximity to resources, control over sky-travel, specialized skills, or one's location on the Titan (e.g., stable highlands vs perilous undercarriage).

### Details

In cities like Anchorpoint or Carapace City, merchant guilds (Pan-Titan Trade Alliance, Aetherium Consortium) and governing bodies (Anchorpoint Authority, Carapace Commission) hold significant power. Sky-Captains and skilled artisans (Guild Artisans) enjoy high status. Miners, farmers, and laborers form the bulk of the population. Remote communities may be led by Elders (Council of Elders) or specialized figures like Beast Wardens or Root Tenders. Nobility, where it exists, might be tied to 'Ridgeborn' or 'Spinecrest' families controlling key territories.

### Impact

Creates distinct class divisions and power struggles within and between settlements. Access to resources and safe locations is a major driver of social stratification and conflict.

## Economic Systems

The economy revolves around resource extraction from the Titans, inter-Titan trade via sky-ship, and specialized crafts. Control over key resources like Aetherium or safe trade routes equals power.

### Details

Key resources include minerals and crystals (Kaelen), timber and flora (Veridian), chitin (Chitinous Expanse), and salvaged materials (Ossus). Trade is conducted via sky-ships navigating The Sky-Currents, facilitated by groups like The Pan-Titan Trade Alliance and The Skyfarers' Concord. Currency often involves barter, raw materials, or standardized tokens backed by powerful factions (perhaps linked to The Aetherium Exchange). Guilds (Sky-Sailors' Guild, Carapace Miners' Union) control specific trades.

### Impact

Drives exploration, conflict, and alliances. Wealth is concentrated in trading hubs and resource-rich areas. Piracy (Black Wind Corsairs) and smuggling (Mire Market Smugglers) thrive on disrupting or bypassing formal trade.

## Everyday Life

Daily life is fundamentally shaped by living on a moving, living creature. Routines are adapted to the local environment, the Titan's stability, and the necessities of survival and trade.

### Details

Common jobs include sky-shipping (Sky-Captain, First Mate), resource gathering (miners, moss harvesters, hunters), crafting (shipwrights, chitin-workers, weavers), farming (in fertile regions like The Verdant Mantle), guiding (Wind Guide), and maintaining infrastructure (Chain Masters, Spire Guards). Hobbies might include sky-fishing, beast taming, storytelling (Storytellers' Guild), or exploring Titan crevices. Daily routines involve checking weather (Sky-Currents), securing homes against Titan tremors, trading for necessities, and participating in local customs and festivals.

### Impact

Fosters resilience, adaptability, and strong community bonds for survival. Creates unique professions and skills tied directly to the Titan environment. Constant awareness of the Titan's presence underlies all aspects of life.
