# Character Creation Overview
This system uses 5 Core Attributes (1-5), Derived Stats (Vitality, Stress, Pressure Tolerance, Air Supply), Skills (0-4), Backgrounds, and Traits. Character creation involves distributing points into Attributes, selecting a Background (which grants skill points, gear, and hooks), choosing a Trait, and calculating Derived Stats. The core resolution mechanic is a d6 Dice Pool system: roll Attribute + Skill dice, 6s are successes. Pushing failed rolls grants Stress. Accumulated Stress adds Stress Dice to pools; these grant successes on 6s but trigger Panic effects on 1s.

# Core Attributes and Stats

## Attributes
*   **Grit**: Physical toughness, resilience against environmental hazards (pressure, temperature, toxins), endurance, raw strength. Governs physical resistance and close-quarters power. Rated 1-5.
*   **Finesse**: Agility, coordination, reaction speed, precision in movement and action. Crucial for piloting, ranged combat, stealth, delicate technical tasks. Rated 1-5.
*   **Acumen**: Mental sharpness, analytical ability, technical knowledge, memory, problem-solving skills. Key for engineering, scientific understanding, investigation, operating complex systems. Rated 1-5.
*   **Resolve**: Mental fortitude, willpower, focus under pressure, resistance to fear, pain, and Abyssal Chorus influence. Governs psychological resilience and concentration. Rated 1-5.
*   **Influence**: Social capability, charisma, persuasiveness, leadership potential, deception, understanding social dynamics. Essential for negotiation, command, factional politics. Rated 1-5.

## Derived Stats
*   **Vitality**: Calculation: Base 5 + Grit. Function: Physical health. Reaching 0 means incapacitation/death.
*   **Stress**: Calculation: Max Stress = Base 5 + Resolve. Function: Accumulated psychological strain. Increases from events, pushing rolls, Chorus exposure. High levels impose penalties. Reaching max causes mental break. Stress Dice added to pools equal current Stress; 6s succeed, 1s cause Panic.
*   **Pressure Tolerance**: Calculation: Base 1 + Grit. Function: Minimal innate resistance to pressure outside gear. Represents buffer against minor leaks/brief exposure. Primarily handled by gear.
*   **Air Supply**: Calculation: Determined by gear capacity (Units). Function: Breathable air in closed systems. Consumed over time/exertion. Running out causes suffocation.
