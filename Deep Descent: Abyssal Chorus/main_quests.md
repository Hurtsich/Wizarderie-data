## Global Quest Arc Overview

The campaign follows the players' journey from encountering localized disturbances caused by the Abyssal Chorus to uncovering its origins in the Nyxos Trench and ultimately confronting the ancient threat. Initially dismissed as isolated incidents or technical malfunctions, the Chorus's influence grows, forcing the Hab-Clusters to acknowledge a danger that threatens their very existence. Players navigate treacherous political waters between factions like the bureaucratic Aethelburg Concordance, the ruthless Mariana Mining Conglomerate (MMC), and the secretive Veridian BioLabs, each with their own agenda regarding the Chorus. They delve into forgotten ruins and hazardous depths, piecing together the truth about the ancient Sleeper civilization, the disastrous Nyxos Breach caused by MMC, and the nature of the Chorus itself. The campaign culminates in a desperate attempt to silence or contain the Chorus, with the fate of humanity's underwater sanctuaries hanging in the balance, heavily influenced by the players' choices, alliances, and sacrifices.

## Act 1: Echoes in the Dark
