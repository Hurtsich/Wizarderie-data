# Whispers of the Nyxos Trench: NPCs

## Ambassador Kaelen Vance

**Role in campaign:** Major Ally/Neutral (Aethelburg Concordance)

**Physical description:** Mid-40s, sharp features softened by weariness. Wears tailored but practical Concordance diplomatic attire (deep blue with silver piping). Often seen holding a datapad, fingers stained slightly with ink from archival work. Eyes are alert but shadowed.

**Backstory:** Rose through the ranks of Aethelburg's diplomatic corps. Witnessed the increasing instability post-Breach and the Concordance's dwindling influence against corporate power. Privately blames MMC for the current crisis but lacks concrete proof. Has an estranged sibling, Dr. Elara Vance, working for Veridian BioLabs.

**Mindset and personality:** Pragmatic, diplomatic, stressed but resolute. Believes in negotiation and compromise but fears the Concordance is outmatched. Carries the weight of Aethelburg's survival. Secretly terrified the Chorus is unstoppable.

**Motivations and goals:** Preserve the Aethelburg Concordance and protect Hab-Cluster citizens. Uncover the truth about the Breach and the Chorus. Find a diplomatic solution to the crisis, avoiding open war between factions. Restore contact and cooperation between Clusters.

**Relationships and connections:** Estranged sibling (Dr. Elara Vance, Veridian). Respected within Concordance, distrusted by MMC, cautious relationship with Wardens. Potential contact within the Librarians of Point Nemo.

**Unique quirks or notable traits:** Taps fingers rhythmically when stressed. Prefers synthesized tea over nutrient paste. Possesses fragments of pre-Breach diplomatic correspondence hinting at MMC negligence (Whisperwind Cipher fragments?).

**Reaction to player choices:** Appreciates players who provide actionable intelligence, act diplomatically, or help Concordance citizens. Becomes wary if players are reckless, openly hostile to the Concordance, or closely allied with MMC/Veridian hardliners. May offer resources/political cover for discreet actions.

**Development potential:** Could become a staunch ally if players earn trust and help the Concordance. Might be forced into morally grey compromises if pressured. Could be targeted by MMC or Cultists. Reconciliation with Elara could be a side plot.

**Physical description:** Late 50s, immaculately dressed in expensive, severe MMC corporate suit. Cold grey eyes, sharp jawline, receding silver hair slicked back. Uses a custom, high-tech prosthetic arm (lost original in an 'industrial accident'). Moves with quiet, predatory confidence.

**Backstory:** Climbed the MMC ladder ruthlessly. Oversaw the Deep Push initiative and the Whisper Trench Outpost operations that led to the Breach. Directly involved in the subsequent cover-up. Views the Chorus as an unforeseen operational hazard and potential resource. Believes MMC is the only entity capable of managing deep-sea resources and ensuring humanity's *true* survival (under its control).

**Mindset and personality:** Cold, calculating, ruthless, arrogant. Utterly loyal to MMC's bottom line and power projection. Views people as assets or obstacles. Master manipulator and corporate strategist. Believes ends justify the means. Minimal empathy.

**Motivations and goals:** Maintain MMC dominance and profitability. Contain/control information about the Breach and Chorus. Exploit any potential resources related to the Sleepers or Chorus phenomenon. Eliminate threats to MMC operations (rivals, investigators, whistleblowers). Ultimately secure MMC control over the Nyxos Trench.

**Relationships and connections:** High-ranking MMC executive. Commands significant corporate resources (security, agents, research teams). Rivals within MMC. Views Veridian as competitors, Concordance as irrelevant obstacles, Cultists as useful chaos agents (sometimes). Enemies with anyone investigating the Breach honestly (potentially the players, Jax, Kaelen Vance).

**Unique quirks or notable traits:** Polishes his prosthetic hand obsessively when plotting. Speaks in measured, corporate euphemisms. Possesses classified data logs from the Whisper Trench Outpost pre-Breach. Secretly fascinated by the Sleeper tech's potential power.

**Reaction to player choices:** Views players as tools or threats. Will try to buy, coerce, or eliminate them based on their actions. Respects competence but despises interference. Will exploit player weaknesses or factional conflicts. If players ally with MMC, he offers resources but demands loyalty and results, discarding them when inconvenient.

**Development potential:** Could escalate tactics significantly if cornered. Might attempt to weaponize the Chorus or Sleeper tech. Could be overthrown by internal MMC rivals or exposed by player actions, leading to corporate infighting.

**Unique quirks or notable traits:** Humming abstract, complex tunes (unconsciously mimicking Chorus fragments?). Keeps genetically modified bioluminescent organisms as 'pets' in her lab. Can discuss horrifying biological processes with unnerving calm. Might possess unique biological samples related to the Chorus Eels or Void Kelp.

**Reaction to player choices:** Intrigued by players possessing unique biological samples or knowledge of the Chorus/Sleepers. May offer access/information in exchange for cooperation or samples. Becomes hostile if players interfere with her research or threaten Veridian interests. Might try to manipulate players into retrieving dangerous artifacts/samples.

**Development potential:** Could become a key ally providing biological insights/countermeasures. Her research could spiral out of control, creating biological threats or Chorus 'amplifiers' (potential twist). Reconciliation with Kaelen possible.

Gestures broadly when speaking, voice shifting from soothing whispers to fervent declarations. Often surrounded by mesmerized followers.

**Backstory:** Likely a low-status worker or fringe dweller pre-Chorus. Was profoundly affected by the Chorus early on, interpreting it as a divine call or cosmic truth. Rose quickly within the Cult due to his charisma and perceived connection to the Chorus. Believes the Chorus offers transcendence and release from the pressures of Hab life.

**Mindset and personality:** Fanatical, charismatic, manipulative, genuinely believes in the Chorus's power. Sees suffering as purification. Views non-believers as pitiable and lost. Prone to ecstatic pronouncements and periods of quiet intensity (listening to the Chorus).

**Motivations and goals:** Spread the "gospel" of the Deep Chorus. Recruit more followers. Undermine established authority (Concordance, Corporations) which he sees as preventing humanity's embrace of the Chorus. Achieve communion with the source of the Chorus (Sleepers?). Guide his flock towards transformation.

**Relationships and connections:** Leader of a local Cult cell. Answers to higher-ranking (perhaps unknown) Cult leaders. Targets vulnerable populations (poor, sick, disillusioned). Enemies with Wardens and anyone trying to suppress the Chorus.

## Archivist Lin

**Role in campaign:** Minor Neutral/Ally (Librarians of Point Nemo)

**Physical description:** Elderly, frail-looking but with sharp, intelligent eyes behind thick lenses. Wears simple, practical robes of the Librarians (grey, unadorned). Hands are gnarled but move deftly among datapads and ancient physical scrolls salvaged pre-Miasma. Surrounded by shelves of data crystals and environmental storage units.

**Backstory:** Dedicated her long life to the Librarians' mission: preserving knowledge from before the Descent and understanding the deep. Remembers stories from the early Cycles. Has curated vast amounts of data, including fragmented records related to pre-Miasma exploration, early Hab-Cluster tech, and cryptic references to deep-sea anomalies (potentially early Sleeper mentions or Abyssal Glyphs).

**Mindset and personality:** Calm, patient, meticulous, dedicated to knowledge preservation above all else. Speaks softly and precisely. Believes knowledge is the key to survival and understanding. Wary of those who would exploit or destroy information (MMC, Cultists). Slightly detached from immediate political struggles.

**Motivations and goals:** Preserve and catalogue knowledge. Assist genuine seekers of information. Understand the historical context of the Chorus and Sleepers. Ensure the survival of the Point Nemo archive. Piece together fragmented lore about the pre-Miasma world and the Great Descent.

Her personal quarters are a chaotic nest of datapads and half-finished translations. Might hold the key to deciphering Abyssal Glyphs or the Whisperwind Cipher.

**Reaction to player choices:** Helps players who demonstrate respect for knowledge and share information freely. Becomes guarded or unhelpful if players seem intent on destruction, theft, or furthering corporate/cultist agendas. May require players to perform a task (retrieving lost data, protecting an artifact) in exchange for rare information.

**Development potential:** Can be a crucial source of lore and clues throughout the campaign. The archive itself could become a target, requiring player intervention. Lin might uncover a critical piece of information that changes the understanding of the Sleepers or Miasma. Could pass on her duties to a player or another NPC if she feels her time is near.

**Physical description:** Mid-30s, looks perpetually sleep-deprived. Wears functional lab gear, often stained with nutrient paste or coolant. Constantly fiddling with a custom neural interface headset. Quick, nervous movements. Intense, obsessive focus in their eyes when discussing their research.

**Backstory:** Brilliant but ostracized neuro-scientist. Became obsessed with the Chorus phenomenon after witnessing its effects. Joined the Synaptic Seekers to pursue research outside mainstream constraints. Believes the Chorus is a complex data stream or form of consciousness that can be decoded and understood, perhaps even interfaced with. Works in a poorly funded, makeshift lab.

**Mindset and personality:** Obsessed, brilliant, ethically ambiguous, impatient. Driven by pure scientific curiosity about the Chorus. Frustrated by lack of resources and mainstream skepticism. Views the potential for discovery as paramount, sometimes overlooking risks. Not malicious, but potentially reckless.

**Motivations and goals:** Decode the Abyssal Chorus. Understand its structure, origin, and effects on the human mind. Develop technology to interface with or shield against the Chorus. Achieve a scientific breakthrough that validates the Synaptic Seekers' work. Gain recognition for their discoveries.

**Relationships and connections:** Member of the Synaptic Seekers (a loose collective). Competes/collaborates with other Seekers. Avoids contact with major factions but may scavenge tech or data from MMC/Veridian castoffs. Might see Dr. Elara Vance (Veridian) as a rival or potential (dangerous) collaborator.

**Unique quirks or notable traits:** Mutters complex equations or data strings under their breath. Lab is filled with jury-rigged equipment and experimental neural interfaces. Experiences mild Chorus side-effects (auditory hallucinations, migraines) due to prolonged proximity/study, which they document rigorously. May have developed experimental Chorus dampeners or detectors.

**Reaction to player choices:** Intrigued by players who have experienced the Chorus directly, possess Sleeper artifacts, or have information about the Nyxos Trench. Might offer experimental tech or data analysis in exchange for cooperation (acting as test subjects, retrieving specific data/samples). Becomes paranoid and hostile if they suspect players want to steal their research or shut them down.

**Development potential:** Their research could lead to valuable tools for understanding/resisting the Chorus, or dangerously unstable technology that attracts unwanted attention or malfunctions catastrophically. Could provide key insights into the Chorus mechanism. Might become a target for the Cult or MMC. Could succumb to the Chorus's influence due to their research.

Carries low-tech survival gear: filtration mask, climbing spikes, sonar pulse-knife. Moves silently and confidently through dark, hazardous environments. Eyes are sharp and miss nothing.

**Backstory:** Grew up in a fringe Hab or among scavenger communities that distrust advanced technology. Affiliated with the Echoes of Earth philosophy, believing reliance on complex tech led to the Miasma and humanity's current predicament. Master navigator of deep-sea currents, forgotten tunnels, and ruined pre-Descent structures using instinct, sonar, and basic tools. Trades information and salvage for essentials. Knows routes others deem impassable. May have heard fragmented Echoes myths about the Miasma's origin or 'safe zones'.

**Mindset and personality:** Independent, self-reliant, distrustful of authority and high technology. Believes in living in balance with the deep, not dominating it. Practical, observant, quiet. Values actions over words. Connected to the rhythms of the abyssal environment.

**Motivations and goals:** Survive independently. Maintain her freedom. Preserve knowledge of low-tech survival and navigation. Avoid entanglement with major factions. Protect the few remaining 'natural' or less-exploited parts of the deep she knows. Possibly find Waypoint Zero, a mythical pre-Descent sanctuary.

**Relationships and connections:** Loose ties to Echoes of Earth communities. Trades with fringe settlements and occasionally Deep Divers (like Jax). Avoids corporate patrols and Warden checkpoints. Knows the territories of certain megafauna.

**Unique quirks or notable traits:** Can navigate by interpreting deep-sea currents and faint magnetic anomalies. Uses bioluminescent fungi/creatures for light sources. Speaks a dialect mixing common tongue with scavenger jargon and archaic terms. Might possess maps or knowledge leading to Sunken Alexandria or other hidden ruins. Knows how to harvest unique biological resources (Void Kelp?).

**Reaction to player choices:** Wary of heavily augmented or tech-reliant players. Respects those who show survival skills, respect for the deep environment, and act honorably. Might guide players through dangerous territory or share knowledge if they offer fair trade (essentials, low-tech gear, protection) or help her against common threats (MMC exploitation, dangerous creatures). Betrays players who endanger her territory or break their word.

**Development potential:** Can be a guide to dangerous, forgotten locations crucial to the plot. Might hold clues related to the Miasma origin or pre-Descent secrets. Could lead players to a hidden Echoes of Earth enclave. Might teach players unique survival skills. Could be hunted by factions wanting her navigational knowledge.

## "Echo"

**Role in campaign:** Mystery/Wildcard (Phantom Fleet of Cygnus X-1?)

**Physical description:** Unknown. Communicates via encrypted, untraceable signals, often appearing as brief data bursts, ghost signals on sonar, or cryptic messages left in secure drops. Voice (if heard) is synthesized or heavily modulated, genderless.

**Backstory:** Unknown. Represents or is connected to the Phantom Fleet, a shadowy organization whose existence is barely rumored. Their motives and origins are a complete mystery. Seems to possess advanced technological capabilities (stealth, communication encryption) and access to surprising amounts of information about other factions' movements and secrets. Might be connected to pre-Descent military or intelligence, or something stranger.

**Mindset and personality:** Cryptic, enigmatic, cautious. Communications are brief, often coded or allegorical. Seems to operate based on a long-term agenda incomprehensible to outsiders. Actions can appear contradictory – sometimes helpful, sometimes obstructive.

**Motivations and goals:** Unknown. Potential goals include: observing the Chorus phenomenon, protecting the Sleepers (potential twist), guiding/manipulating events towards a specific outcome, preventing a catastrophe worse than the Chorus, recovering lost technology, acting as custodians of a hidden truth.

**Relationships and connections:** Affiliated with the Phantom Fleet. No known allies or enemies, operates outside established structures. Seems aware of the players and major faction leaders.

**Unique quirks or notable traits:** Communications often contain static bursts resembling Chorus fragments or complex star charts. May leave behind untraceable technological artifacts or use unique energy signatures. Timing of interventions seems significant but obscure.

**Reaction to player choices:** Responds unpredictably. Might offer cryptic warnings or vital intel if player actions align with their unknown agenda (e.g., investigating Sleepers without trying to destroy them, opposing reckless exploitation of the Chorus). Might actively hinder players if they threaten the Fleet's goals or secrets. Cannot be easily contacted; initiates communication on its own terms.

**Development potential:** Serves as a major source of mystery and potential plot twists. Gradual revelation of the Phantom Fleet's nature and goals could be a central arc. Could become a powerful, enigmatic ally or a final, unexpected antagonist depending on their ultimate purpose (e.g., protecting Sleepers at humanity's expense). Might provide unique technology or access to otherwise unreachable locations.

## Silas Vance, MMC Section Chief (Security & Logistics)

**Role in campaign:** Antagonist/Neutral (Mariana Mining Conglomerate - MMC)

**Physical description:** Mid-40s, sharp features etched with stress lines beneath short, receding dark hair. Wears a pristine, dark grey MMC uniform, often with the collar slightly askew. Has a cybernetic eye that glows faintly red when accessing data or under stress. His movements are precise and economical, conveying restrained tension.

**Backstory:** Silas climbed the MMC ladder through ruthless efficiency after losing family in early Hab-Cluster conflicts he blames on Concordance weakness. He witnessed the 'Breach' aftermath, solidifying his belief that only MMC's iron grip prevents total chaos. He sees the Nyxos Trench and its inhabitants primarily as resources to be managed for corporate profit and, by extension, survival.

**Mindset and personality:** Coldly pragmatic, results-oriented, and deeply loyal to the MMC structure (if not Thorne personally). Believes the ends (profit, order) justify harsh means. Views workers as expendable assets and regulations as obstacles. Secretly terrified of the Chorus disrupting operations and revealing potential corner-cutting in his sector. Calm under pressure but prone to quiet fury when quotas are missed or authority challenged.

**Motivations and goals:** Meet or exceed productivity quotas set by superiors. Maintain absolute security and control within his sector. Suppress any dissent (especially from the Deep Divers Guild). Gain favour with Director Thorne or other influential executives. Cover up any safety violations or unethical practices within his jurisdiction.

**Relationships and connections:** Reports to a regional manager under Director Aris Thorne. Views Warden liaisons (like Sgt. Valerius) as bureaucratic hindrances. Despises the Deep Divers Guild. Sees Veridian BioLabs as unpredictable competitors. May utilize black market contacts ('Silas' the Broker) for deniable assets or resources.

**Unique quirks or notable traits:** Constantly checking his data slate. Taps his cybernetic eye rhythmically when deep in thought. Drinks heavily but maintains composure in public. Has a meticulous, almost obsessive need for order in his environment.

**Reaction to player choices:** If players disrupt MMC operations, he becomes a direct antagonist, deploying security forces and corporate resources. If players provide useful intel or inadvertently aid his goals, he might offer temporary, purely transactional cooperation, always seeking an angle for MMC's benefit. He respects competence, even in adversaries, but despises idealism.

**Development potential:** Can escalate into a significant recurring antagonist. Might possess incriminating evidence against Director Thorne or MMC practices that players could leverage. Could potentially be turned against superiors if his own position or the sector's stability is severely threatened by a larger crisis (e.g., massive Chorus event, Phantom Fleet intervention).

## Sergeant Korbin Valerius, Warden Field Officer

**Role in campaign:** Ally/Neutral (The Wardens)

**Physical description:** Late 30s, rugged face with a faded scar across one cheekbone. Close-cropped dark hair, tired but alert grey eyes. Moves with the quiet competence of a veteran soldier. Wears standard Warden armour, scuffed and personalized with minor additions. Often seen field-stripping or cleaning his pulse rifle during downtime.

**Backstory:** Joined the Wardens seeking structure after his family's small Hab-Cluster was destroyed in a catastrophe he suspects MMC covered up. He's a veteran of numerous skirmishes, salvage operations, and Chorus-related containment actions. Loyal to his squad above all else and respects Commander Rostova, but deeply cynical about the Concordance's effectiveness and MMC's ethics.

**Mindset and personality:** Gruff, pragmatic, and outwardly by-the-book, but possesses a strong sense of justice and protectiveness towards civilians and his own team. Weary of the constant danger and political games. Has a dark, gallows humour. Suspicious of outsiders but fair.

**Motivations and goals:** Keep his squad alive and operational. Uphold Warden duties – protecting Hab-Clusters, enforcing laws, containing threats. Gather actionable intelligence on Chorus activity, criminal elements, and factional overreach (especially MMC). Secretly hopes to find concrete proof of MMC wrongdoing related to his past.

**Relationships and connections:** Directly serves under Commander Eva Rostova, generally loyal but capable of quiet disagreement. Has professional but often tense interactions with MMC security (like Vance's units). Respects competent Deep Divers ('Knuckles' Grogan) but enforces regulations. Views the Cult of the Deep Chorus with professional hostility.

**Unique quirks or notable traits:** Constantly chews synthetic stim-sticks. Has a habit of quoting obscure pre-Miasma military theorists. Refers to his pulse rifle as "Vera". Can sleep anywhere, anytime, if needed.

**Reaction to player choices:** If players operate within the law (or plausibly appear to) and don't endanger civilians, he can be a valuable source of information, backup, or official access. If players engage in blatant criminal activity or reckless behaviour, he will act decisively to apprehend them. He responds well to competence and honesty, even if the players are operating outside the system.

**Development potential:** Can become a reliable ally, offering tactical support and insights into Warden operations. His personal vendetta against MMC could align with player objectives. Might face a crisis of conscience, forcing him to choose between orders and doing what's right, potentially siding with the players against corrupt elements.

## Sister Lyra, Cult Ritual Preparator

**Role in campaign:** Antagonist (Cult of the Deep Chorus)

**Physical description:** Appears unnervingly serene, mid-30s, with pale, almost translucent skin and wide, dark eyes that seem slightly unfocused but intensely observant. Wears simple, layered robes in deep blues and greens, often damp. Carries ritual components: strangely carved cetacean bones, bioluminescent fungi in jars, vials of murky trench water. Speaks in a soft, hypnotic cadence. Minor physical mutations might be subtly visible (e.g., faintly iridescent patches on skin, slightly elongated fingers).

**Backstory:** Was a low-level technician in a Hab-Cluster hydro-garden before experiencing a profound 'awakening' during a localized Chorus event. Believes the Chorus offers liberation from the crushing deep and that the mutations/madness are divine transformations. Her fervent belief and ability to 'attune' others brought her prominence within the Cult.

**Mindset and personality:** Fanatical yet calm, patient, manipulative. Genuinely believes the Cult's doctrine and sees their actions as sacred duties. Views non-believers with pity or as obstacles to enlightenment. Unfazed by gore or suffering if deemed necessary for ritual purity or serving the Chorus. Highly perceptive of emotional vulnerabilities.

**Motivations and goals:** Identify and prepare individuals sensitive to the Chorus for initiation. Locate and sanctify sites with strong Chorus resonance or Sleeper connections. Perform rituals to amplify the Chorus's influence or achieve specific effects (e.g., localized madness, summoning phenomena). Deepen her own connection to the Chorus towards ultimate 'communion'.

**Relationships and connections:** Reveres the entity/phenomenon behind the Chorus. Works closely with Brother Malachi, handling recruitment screening and ritual logistics. Views Veridian BioLabs as blasphemers dissecting the divine. Actively seeks out individuals like Kaya. Has a network of hidden initiates and sympathizers.

**Unique quirks or notable traits:** Hums discordant, oddly compelling melodies unconsciously. Collects strange deep-sea flora/fauna with resonant properties. Her eyes sometimes pulse with faint, internal bioluminescence when concentrating or near strong Chorus influence. Seems immune to extreme cold.

**Reaction to player choices:** Initially views players as potential converts, especially if they show sensitivity or interest (genuine or feigned). Will use subtle manipulation, 'testing' their attunement. If players actively oppose the Cult or disrupt rituals, she becomes a dangerous foe, using her knowledge of Chorus lore, ritual magic (GM discretion), and directing Cult assets (initiates, potentially minor Chorus-affected creatures) against them without hesitation.

**Development potential:** Can be a source of esoteric lore about the Chorus, its perceived doctrines, and ritual practices. Her actions might lead players to hidden Cult cells or sacred sites. Could potentially be exploited if players understand her specific interpretations or ritual requirements. Unlikely to be redeemed due to deep indoctrination.

## Dr. Aris Thorne (No relation to MMC Director), Veridian Bio-Technician

**Role in campaign:** Neutral/Potential Ally (Veridian BioLabs)

**Physical description:** Early 30s, perpetually sleep-deprived with dark circles under his eyes. Wears a stained Veridian lab coat over mismatched casual clothes. Thick optical enhancers magnify his intense, curious brown eyes. Gesticulates wildly with his hands when explaining things. Lab space is a barely controlled chaos of glowing samples, tangled wires, nutrient paste smears, and complex apparatus.

**Backstory:** A bio-engineering prodigy fast-tracked into Veridian. Initially focused on deep-sea adaptation, he became fascinated by the unique biological energy signatures associated with the Chorus after analyzing samples from a containment breach. His current project, exploring potential communication or energy applications of Chorus-linked bioluminescence, is underfunded and considered fringe by Veridian management.

**Mindset and personality:** Hyper-intelligent, obsessive, driven by pure scientific curiosity that often overshadows ethical considerations or personal safety. Socially awkward and easily distractible. Prone to jargon-filled explanations. Excitable when presented with new data or phenomena. Secretly anxious about the potential misuse of his discoveries.

**Motivations and goals:** Fully understand the mechanisms and potential of Chorus-induced bioluminescence. Develop a working prototype demonstrating its application (e.g., communication device, energy source). Gain recognition, funding, and resources for his research. Avoid attracting negative attention from Veridian security or corporate espionage (especially MMC).

**Relationships and connections:** Admires Dr. Elara Vance's work but is slightly intimidated and operates somewhat in her shadow. Views MMC as corporate thugs uninterested in pure science. Might cautiously share data with Synaptic Seekers if their interests overlap. Unaware of the true nature of the Cult, seeing them merely as biologically interesting deviants.

**Unique quirks or notable traits:** Talks to his bioluminescent cultures. Forgets basic needs like food or sleep when engrossed. Constantly fiddles with glowing vials or data readouts. Uses complex scientific metaphors for everyday situations. His lab emits a faint, shifting glow.

**Reaction to player choices:** If players provide unique biological samples (especially Chorus-affected), data on Chorus phenomena, or relevant Sleeper tech fragments, he becomes an enthusiastic, if distractible, ally. He might share potentially sensitive research data if he thinks it will help his own work, possibly carelessly. Threats to his lab or research will make him paranoid and trigger security protocols or alert Veridian.

**Development potential:** His research could provide vital clues about the Chorus's biological mechanisms, potential detection methods, or interactions with Sleeper tech. His lab could be a source of unique items, experimental hazards, or a target for other factions. Could be manipulated due to his scientific focus and social naivete. Might make a breakthrough with dangerous implications.

## Administrator Jena Solara, Concordance Resource Allocation Officer

**Role in campaign:** Neutral/Potential Ally (Aethelburg Concordance)

**Physical description:** Late 40s, looks perpetually tired and stressed. Wears standard, functional Concordance administrative attire, neat but slightly worn. Hair pulled back tightly, emphasizing lines around her eyes and mouth. Carries a thick data slate almost constantly. Moves with brisk, harried efficiency.

**Backstory:** Joined the Concordance years ago, believing in its mission of fair governance. Rose through the administrative ranks, only to find herself mired in bureaucracy, scarcity politics, and compromises. The Concordance's declining influence post-Breach has left her feeling increasingly disillusioned but still trying to do her job ethically within impossible constraints. Secretly suspects corruption higher up.

**Mindset and personality:** Overworked, cynical, yet retains a core of idealism and a desire for fairness. Stressed by the constant need to make unpopular decisions impacting people's survival. Deeply distrustful of MMC's power and Veridian's secrecy. Sharp mind for logistics and regulations, but often feels powerless against the system. Can be brusque due to pressure but fundamentally decent.

**Motivations and goals:** Ensure the fairest possible distribution of scarce resources within her jurisdiction. Maintain public order related to rationing and resource access. Navigate political pressures from superiors, MMC, and other groups without completely compromising her ethics. Identify and potentially expose resource hoarding or corruption (if feasible and safe). Keep her sector functioning.

**Relationships and connections:** Reports to higher-level Concordance officials (some potentially compromised). Coordinates with Warden liaisons (like Sgt. Valerius) for rationing enforcement. Has tense negotiations with MMC reps (like Silas Vance) demanding resources or permits. Deals with Deep Diver Guild reps (like 'Knuckles' Grogan) regarding labor allocation and needs. Aware of fringe groups like Echoes of Earth but has few resources to offer.

**Unique quirks or notable traits:** Constantly reviewing resource manifests on her data slate. Sighs audibly when frustrated. Drinks large quantities of bitter synth-kaf. Rubs her temples when facing a difficult decision. Knows Concordance regulations inside and out.

**Reaction to player choices:** If players demonstrate a genuine desire to help the community, provide verifiable information about corruption or resource theft, or offer critical resources, she can become a cautious ally, providing access to records, permits, or routing information (potentially bending rules slightly). If players disrupt resource distribution, incite unrest, or act purely selfishly, she will use bureaucratic channels and Warden requests to shut them down.

**Development potential:** Can be a crucial source of information on Hab-Cluster politics, resource vulnerabilities, smuggling routes, and Concordance procedures. Could provide leads on corruption or factional disputes. Players might need her authorization for certain actions or access. Her struggle embodies the decay and challenges facing the Concordance.

## 'Knuckles' Grogan, Deep Diver Guild Foreman

**Role in campaign:** Neutral/Potential Ally (Deep Divers Guild)

**Physical description:** Mid-50s, powerfully built frame starting to thicken. Bald head contrasts with a thick grey beard often stained with grease. Arms covered in faded tattoos of deep-sea leviathans and Guild symbols. Wears patched-up, heavy-duty work coveralls. Missing two fingers on his left hand (a common diving injury). Voice is a low, gravelly rumble.

**Backstory:** A lifer in the deeps. Worked independent salvage before MMC consolidation forced most divers into the Guild for survival. Has seen decades of trench evolution, corporate exploitation, and the rise of the Chorus threat. Commands respect through experience, toughness, and his willingness to confront MMC managers. Lost his son years ago in a diving accident he blames squarely on faulty MMC life support tech.

**Mindset and personality:** Gruff, pragmatic, fiercely loyal to his fellow divers ('his crew'). Deeply suspicious of corporations (especially MMC), politicians (Concordance), and smooth-talking outsiders. Believes in solidarity, hard work, and looking out for your own. Holds grudges but is fair-minded among his peers. Possesses vast practical knowledge of the trench environment.

**Motivations and goals:** Secure fair contracts, safe working conditions, and better equipment for his divers. Protect Guild operational areas from MMC encroachment. Acquire essential supplies and parts (often through salvage or back channels). Keep his crew safe from industrial hazards and the increasing strangeness linked to the Chorus. Find concrete proof of MMC negligence that led to his son's death.

**Relationships and connections:** Respected informal leader within the Deep Divers Guild network. Frequently clashes with MMC section managers like Silas Vance over contracts and safety issues. Has wary dealings with Concordance officials like Jena Solara regarding labor and resource access. Might trade salvage or information with black market contacts ('Silas') for needed gear. Views Wardens like Sgt. Valerius as necessary but often out of touch with divers' realities.

**Unique quirks or notable traits:** Cracks his knuckles loudly and frequently (the source of his nickname). Spits often (a habit hard to break from lower-pressure environments). Uses colourful, often nautical or industrial, curses. Almost always carries a heavy, customized wrench.

**Reaction to player choices:** Initially suspicious and standoffish. If players show respect for the divers' work, offer practical assistance (repairs, valuable salvage info, medical aid), or take actions against MMC oppression, he can become a staunch, valuable ally. He offers access to Guild resources (shelter, workshops, transport, manpower for a price/favour) and unparalleled knowledge of trench geography and hazards. Betraying the Guild's trust earns his lasting enmity.

**Development potential:** Can provide unique access to dangerous or restricted dive zones, specialized deep-sea equipment, or the working-class information network. His anti-MMC stance could fuel quests targeting the corporation. Could be a central figure in labour disputes or resistance movements. Might possess anecdotal knowledge of strange ruins or phenomena encountered on dives that relate to the Sleepers or Chorus.

## 'Silas' (Codename), Black Market Broker

**Role in campaign:** Neutral (Independent/Criminal)

**Physical description:** Deliberately nondescript and variable. Favors concealing clothing: hoods, masks, bulky environmental suits, optical distortion fields. Rarely seen clearly, prefers dimly lit locations or digital communication. Voice often uses a modulator. Known more by reputation and encrypted call sign than physical appearance. When glimpsed, seems average height/build, moves quietly.

**Backstory:** Unknown and intentionally obscured. Rumours abound: ex-corporate intelligence, disgraced Concordance archivist, Phantom Fleet dropout. 'Silas' is certainly an alias. They emerged as a key player in the black market after the Breach created widespread instability and demand for off-the-books resources. Master of compartmentalization and operational security.

**Mindset and personality:** Purely transactional and pragmatic. Motivation is profit and self-preservation. Values reliability, discretion, and prompt payment above all else. Amoral – will deal with any faction if the risk/reward calculus is favourable. Paranoid and meticulous about avoiding direct exposure or entanglement with major powers.

**Motivations and goals:** Maximize profit through brokering goods, information, and contacts. Expand network and influence within the underworld. Maintain absolute anonymity and security. Acquire rare or unique items (especially salvage, restricted tech, actionable intel) to leverage for higher prices. Avoid attracting direct attention from Wardens, MMC Security, or Veridian Internal Affairs.

**Relationships and connections:** Maintains a carefully managed network of suppliers (smugglers, corrupt officials, desperate researchers), clients (players, faction operatives, criminals), and informants across various levels of Hab society. Uses dead drops, cutouts, and encrypted channels exclusively. Has rivals in the black market they occasionally undermine.

**Unique quirks or notable traits:** Communicates almost exclusively through encrypted text/audio messages. Uses rotating code phrases and security protocols. Never conducts deals in the same place twice. Avoids physical contact. May possess subtle cybernetic enhancements related to data security or perception.

**Reaction to player choices:** Views players as potential customers or competitors. If players seek illicit goods/services and can meet Silas's price (credits, valuable items, favours, information) and demonstrate reliability, Silas will deal professionally but always maintain distance and security. Betrayal, attempts to uncover their identity, or drawing unwanted attention will result in swift, indirect retaliation (misinformation, tips to enemies, sabotage). Consistent, profitable, and discreet business might grant access to rarer stock or more sensitive intel.

**Development potential:** A vital resource for players needing restricted gear, bypassing security systems, finding specific intel, or making contact with hard-to-reach individuals. Can also inadvertently lead players into traps or betray them if advantageous. Unmasking Silas could be a challenging side investigation. Might possess dangerous knowledge or items related to the core mysteries, acquired through illicit channels.

## Kaya, Chorus-Touched Drifter

**Role in campaign:** Neutral/Wildcard (Unaffiliated)

**Physical description:** Early 20s, gaunt frame, haunted expression. Wears layers of scavenged, ill-fitting clothes. Most striking feature is mismatched eyes: one a normal brown, the other milky white, seemingly blind, but which occasionally pulses with a faint, internal violet light, especially near Chorus activity or Sleeper tech. Often seen muttering quietly or compulsively sketching bizarre, intricate patterns on any available surface.

**Backstory:** Exposed to a powerful Chorus surge during childhood, possibly near a previously unknown Sleeper site activated during the Breach. Others nearby died or went violently mad; Kaya survived but was irrevocably changed. Ostracized due to fear and superstition, they drift between the lower levels of Hab-Clusters, surviving by scavenging and avoiding attention. The 'whispers' and visions are a constant, confusing, sometimes insightful companion.

**Mindset and personality:** Fragmented, fearful, highly sensitive. Struggles to differentiate reality from Chorus-induced perceptions. Can shift rapidly between moments of startling lucidity and paranoid confusion. Deeply lonely but terrified of attracting the wrong kind of attention. Possesses an intuitive, non-linear 'feel' for the Chorus's patterns and impending events. Not malicious, but erratic and potentially dangerous if cornered.

**Motivations and goals:** Find moments of quiet/clarity away from the overwhelming 'noise' of the Chorus. Understand the meaning behind the disturbing visions and whispers. Basic survival – find food, shelter, avoid harassment. Avoid the Cult (who might try to capture or use them) and authorities (who might lock them up).

**Relationships and connections:** Actively avoids most people. Might form tentative, wary connections with individuals who show persistent kindness and patience without trying to exploit them. Generally feared or pitied by Hab dwellers. Actively sought by the Cult (Sister Lyra finds them fascinating) and possibly monitored by Synaptic Seekers or Veridian researchers interested in Chorus effects.

**Unique quirks or notable traits:** Compulsive sketching of complex, non-Euclidean patterns. Experiences synesthesia-like phenomena (e.g., 'hearing' pressure changes, 'seeing' emotional states as colours). Has flashes of unsettling, often symbolic, precognition. The milky eye visibly reacts (pulsing light) to strong psychic or technological fields related to the Chorus/Sleepers.

**Reaction to player choices:** Highly unpredictable, depends on their current mental state and interpretation of the 'whispers'. Patience, non-threatening approaches, and genuine attempts to help (offering food, shelter, quiet) might elicit cryptic clues, warnings, or insights related to the Chorus, Sleeper sites, or immediate dangers. Aggression, attempts to capture, or perceived threats will trigger panic, potentially lashing out with uncontrolled minor psychic phenomena or desperate flight.

**Development potential:** A living conduit to the Chorus, potentially offering unique perspectives or clues unobtainable elsewhere. Could lead players (intentionally or not) to hidden locations or dangerous phenomena. Protecting Kaya could become a moral objective for the players. Might gain greater control over their abilities or succumb further to the Chorus's influence based on player interactions or campaign events. Their visions could be key to understanding the overarching plot.

## Councillor Rhea Thane, Representative of Hab-Minor Terminus

**Role in campaign:** Neutral/Potential Ally (Independent Hab-Cluster: Terminus)

**Physical description:** Mid-40s, practical and sturdy build suggesting physical labor in her past. Wears functional, heavily insulated clothing common in Terminus due to its colder environment. Carries herself with quiet determination and resilience. Short, practical grey hair frames an intelligent, wary face. Hands are calloused.

**Backstory:** Born and raised in Terminus, a Hab founded by groups seeking autonomy from the Concordance and MMC. Worked as a life support technician and hydroponics manager before being elected Councillor. Terminus constantly battles extreme pressure fluctuations, aggressive local megafauna unknown in shallower Hab zones, and failing infrastructure salvaged from older wrecks. Rhea fiercely defends Terminus's independence while desperately seeking resources or trade.

**Mindset and personality:** Resilient, pragmatic, resourceful. Deeply protective of her community and fiercely independent. Distrustful of the major factions, viewing MMC as predatory and the Concordance as ineffective and self-interested. Believes in community solidarity and practical solutions over political maneuvering. Honest but shrewd negotiator.

**Motivations and goals:** Secure vital resources (power cells, advanced filtration units, medical supplies, specific alloys) for Terminus's survival. Maintain the Hab's structural integrity against extreme environmental pressures. Protect Terminus from unique local threats (fauna, geological instability). Preserve Terminus's autonomy in any dealings with outsiders. Find reliable, fair trade partners.

**Relationships and connections:** Represents Terminus in rare, often frustrating, dealings with the Concordance bureaucracy (like Administrator Solara's office). Avoids MMC contact whenever possible but may be forced into exploitative resource deals. Might have cautious trade relationships with reputable Deep Diver crews or independent salvagers. Views the Cult and Phantom Fleet as distant threats, less immediate than failing O2 scrubbers. Commands strong loyalty within Terminus.

**Unique quirks or notable traits:** Always carries a specialized, heavy-duty multi-tool. Speaks plainly and directly, disliking jargon. Possesses encyclopedic knowledge of Terminus's unique environmental hazards and endemic life forms. Drinks a potent, bitter algae-based brew favoured in Terminus.

**Reaction to player choices:** If players arrive at Terminus seeking refuge or passage, Rhea will be cautious but potentially offer limited aid if they prove non-threatening and willing to contribute (labour, expertise, barter). If players offer genuinely beneficial trade (especially rare tech or resources), vital intelligence, or help defending Terminus against a major threat, she can become a steadfast ally, offering shelter, local knowledge, and access to Terminus's unique (if limited) resources. Exploiting Terminus or endangering its people will unite the community against the players under her leadership.

**Development potential:** Terminus can serve as a remote base, a source of unique environmental challenges, or quests related to its specific survival needs. Rhea might possess knowledge or salvaged items relevant to the deeper trench mysteries (e.g., proximity to unusual Sleeper ruins, unique Chorus manifestations). Her struggle highlights the plight of independent settlements. Could be a key player in any effort to unite smaller Hab-Clusters.

## Dr. Kaelen Mori, Independent Xenotech Researcher

**Role in campaign:** Neutral/Potential Ally (Independent/Fringe)

**Physical description:** Appears somewhat ageless, potentially late 50s but with an unusual vitality (perhaps due to self-experimentation or tech). Intense, piercing eyes behind corrective lenses or integrated optical display. Wears high-quality, practical gear subtly incorporating functional, salvaged Sleeper-tech elements (e.g., power source indicator, atmospheric sensor). Moves with quiet, deliberate precision.

**Backstory:** Formerly a highly regarded researcher (likely at Point Nemo or a Veridian R&D division) obsessed with pre-Breach hints of Sleeper existence. Clashed with superiors over the direction or perceived danger of their research – either the Librarians' excessive caution or Veridian's purely exploitative aims. Faked death or was officially disgraced/expelled. Now operates entirely independently, piecing together fragments of Sleeper tech and data, seeking to understand its true purpose, the nature of the 'Sleepers', and its link to the Abyssal Chorus.

**Mindset and personality:** Intensely focused, secretive, brilliant, and bordering on obsessive. Driven by a pure, almost monomaniacal quest for knowledge about the Sleepers. Views the Chorus as a dangerous consequence or corruption of Sleeper functions. Cautious to the point of paranoia about sharing findings but might collaborate with individuals deemed competent, trustworthy, and genuinely interested in understanding (not just power or profit). Can be intellectually arrogant.

**Motivations and goals:** Unravel the mysteries of Sleeper technology: its origin, purpose, and principles. Discover the true nature of the entities known as 'Sleepers'. Find a way to understand, neutralize, or perhaps even control the Abyssal Chorus, potentially using Sleeper tech itself. Avoid detection and interference by major factions. Potentially locate a central Sleeper site or 'source'.

**Relationships and connections:** Works almost entirely alone. May use encrypted channels or cutouts (like 'Silas') to acquire rare materials or data discreetly. Views all major factions (MMC, Veridian, Concordance, Cult) as obstacles, threats, or fools incapable of handling the knowledge. Might hold a grudging respect for the Librarians' preservation mandate but condemns their timidity. Sees Synaptic Seekers as amateurs stumbling in the dark. Individuals like Kaya might be subjects of intense, remote interest.

**Unique quirks or notable traits:** Speaks in precise, often technical or academic language. Frequently references obscure pre-Miasma scientific theories or paradoxes. Subtly integrates functioning Sleeper artifacts into personal equipment. Keeps meticulous, heavily encrypted research logs. Lab/hideout is likely protected by sophisticated salvaged tech defenses.

**Reaction to player choices:** Extremely wary and difficult to locate. If players possess significant Sleeper artifacts, unique data unavailable elsewhere, or demonstrate both competence and a genuine interest in understanding the tech's implications (beyond simple use), Mori might cautiously initiate contact or agree to limited exchange. Requires proof of trustworthiness and discretion. Any sign of recklessness, factional allegiance, or attempts to steal research will result in Mori vanishing, sealing off access, or activating lethal defenses.

**Development potential:** A potential major source of exposition, advanced technology, and quests related to Sleeper artifacts, ruins, and the campaign's central mysteries. Could hold the key to understanding or mitigating the Chorus. Might possess dangerous knowledge or technology that could destabilize the region if misused. Could become a powerful, albeit eccentric, ally or a misguided antagonist if their research leads them down dangerous paths. Finding Mori's hidden lab could be a significant objective.
