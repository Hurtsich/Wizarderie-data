## Aethelburg Station / Aethelburg Concordance

### Quest: The Whispering Delegate

*   **Description:** A visiting delegate from a minor Hab-Cluster, crucial for an upcoming Concordance vote on resource allocation (potentially impacting Chorus relief efforts), is exhibiting paranoia and making erratic accusations. Is it pressure, Chorus influence, or sabotage orchestrated by rivals (like MMC)?
*   **Challenges:** Discreet investigation (surveillance, social checks), navigating diplomatic protocol, analyzing delegate's behavior/environment for psychic residue or tampering, potential confrontation if sabotage is uncovered.
*   **Outcomes:**
    *   *Success (Chorus):* Identify subtle Chorus influence. Concordance quarantines delegate, vote delayed, raises alarm about Chorus's insidious nature. Gain Concordance trust.
    *   *Success (Sabotage):* Uncover evidence of tampering (e.g., psychoactive agents planted by MMC agents). Expose plot, potentially shifting political landscape. Gain Concordance favor, MMC enmity.
    *   *Failure:* Delegate causes diplomatic incident during vote/meeting. Concordance loses face, resource allocation fails/is skewed, potential unrest.
*   **Required Actions:** Investigation, social interaction, potential tech/medical scans, choice on how to present findings.
*   **Rewards:** Concordance reputation, political favors, credits, potential intel on MMC tactics or Chorus effects.
*   **Multiple Approaches:** Focus on social manipulation, technical investigation, or even direct confrontation/capture of saboteurs.

They need rare biological samples from extremely hazardous deep-sea vents near the Nyxos influence zone. Thorne offers significant rewards but Veridian Security is actively hunting them.
*   **Challenges:** Deep-sea exploration into hazardous zone (environmental dangers, Chorus-affected fauna), precise biological sample collection, evading Veridian patrols/tracking, evaluating Thorne's ethics/sanity, potential moral dilemma about the research's implications (weaponization?).
*   **Outcomes:**
    *   *Success (Samples Delivered):* Thorne makes progress (or claims to). Players get reward, potential future access to anti-Chorus measures (or dangerous bioweapons). Veridian steps up hunt.
    *   *Success (Thorne Captured):* Players lead Veridian to Thorne (or Thorne is caught due to player actions). Gain Veridian favor, Thorne's research confiscated (potentially misused by Veridian).
    *   *Success (Research Sabotaged):* Players deem research too dangerous and sabotage it. Earn enmity of Thorne, potentially Veridian if they wanted the research. Moral implications.
