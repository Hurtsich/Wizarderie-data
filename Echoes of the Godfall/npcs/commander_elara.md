## Physical Description
Stern woman in her late 40s, wearing practical, well-maintained Keeper armor. Short-cropped grey hair, sharp eyes, a network of old scars on her face and hands. Carries a modified pre-Fall energy rifle.

## Background

  - Keeper Scholars (like Keeper Atheria): Respects their knowledge but prioritizes security
  - Prophet Malakor / Rot Cult: Sworn Enemy
  - Shard Covenant: Wary Rivalry/Occasional Cooperation
  - Agent Silus: Deeply Suspicious (May suspect infiltration)
- **Secrets:**
  - Haunted by past failures and lives lost under her command.
  - Knows of a critical vulnerability in Echo Bastion's defenses.
  - Privately doubts the Keepers' ability to truly restore the past, focusing more on pragmatic survival.
  - May possess a piece of dangerous, forbidden pre-Fall knowledge she keeps hidden even from other Keepers.

## Personality

  - Disciplined
  - Pragmatic
  - Courageous
  - Weary
  - Protective (of her people & the Bastion)
  - Fair but Stern
- **Values:**
  - Order
  - Knowledge (as a tool for survival)
  - Duty
  - Community
  - Preservation of Life
  - Preparedness
- **Fears:**
  - Echo Bastion falling
  - Losing more people
  - The Keepers losing their way
  - Becoming corrupted by the horrors they fight
- **Desires:**
  - Ensure Echo Bastion's survival
  - Protect the innocent
  - Recover knowledge that can actively help people now
  - Find a way to permanently reduce the threat of echoes and whispers

## Motivations
- Defend Echo Bastion and its inhabitants.
- Combat the threats of the Rot Cult and dangerous echoes.
- Preserve knowledge necessary for survival and rebuilding.

## Goals
- Maintain and strengthen Echo Bastion's defenses.
- Lead successful operations against threats.
- Recover actionable pre-Fall data or technology.

## Development Potential
Could become hardened and ruthless, or more open to cooperation. Might sacrifice herself for the Bastion. Could uncover a major secret forcing her to question her loyalty to the Keepers' official doctrine. May become a key leader in a larger alliance.

## Reaction to Players
Initially cautious and professional. Values competence and results. Will offer support and resources if players prove reliable and align with Keeper goals (protecting innocents, fighting cults, recovering knowledge). Distrusts recklessness, secrecy, or ties to dangerous factions (Fleshbinders, Rot Cult).
