Supporting NPC (Bleak Harbor Contact)

## Physical Description
Thin, wiry frame, skin perpetually damp and smelling of brine and decay. Missing teeth, eyes dart nervously. Wears patched oilskins. Moves with a shuffling gait.

## Background
- **Origin:** A low-life scavenger and occasional informant living off the scraps of Bleak Harbor.
- **Significant Events:**

  - Bleak Harbor: Home Turf
  - Mutated Sea Life: Fear/Source of income
  - Smugglers: Occasional employers/contacts
- **Secrets:**
  - Knows hidden spots along the docks and coastline.
  - Witnessed a secret meeting or transaction they weren't supposed to see.
  - Suffering from a slow-acting parasitic infection from handling tainted catches.

## Personality
- **Traits:**
  - Skittish
  - Greedy
  - Suspicious
  - Resourceful (in a low way)
  - Talkative (when paid)
- **Values:**
  - Survival
  - Coin
  - Staying out of trouble (mostly)
- **Fears:**
  - Mutated leviathans
  - Being caught by authorities/gangs
  - Starving
  - Their infection worsening
- **Desires:**
  - Easy money
  - A safe place to sleep
  - A cure for their ailment

## Motivations
- Survive day-to-day in Bleak Harbor.
- Earn enough coin for food and basic needs.

## Goals
- Find valuable salvage.
- Sell information without getting killed.
- Avoid attracting dangerous attention.

## Connections
- Bleak Harbor: Resident
- Ichorfen Marshes / Coastline: Scavenging grounds
- Local Smugglers / Fleshbinder low-level contacts: Known associates

## Development Potential
Can serve as a source of local rumors, minor quests, or information about coastal threats. Might betray the players for coin, or become a surprisingly loyal (if pathetic) ally if treated well. Their infection could become a plot point.

## Reaction to Players
Initially suspicious and demanding payment for any information or service. Easily bribed or intimidated (to a point). Knows more than they initially let on but fears repercussions. Reliability is questionable.
