## Development Potential
Can be a recurring source of politically motivated quests in Shard City. Players' actions will affect his standing and potentially the balance of power in the Covenant. Trustworthiness is always questionable.

## Reaction to Players
Approaches players discreetly or through intermediaries. Offers well-paying but morally grey quests. Values competence and discretion above all. Rewards success generously but punishes failure or betrayal harshly.
