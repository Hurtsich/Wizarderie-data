## Development Potential
Serves as the primary hook for the Sunken Archive questline. Communication may become clearer as players get closer or find related artifacts. Could reveal key lore about the pre-Fall world, the Godfall, or Lyra herself.

## Reaction to Players
Manifests as fragmented visions, sounds, or feelings. Drawn to players seeking knowledge or carrying related items. Cannot communicate directly but provides clues through recurring symbols, emotions, or pointing gestures. Responds positively to attempts to preserve knowledge, negatively to destruction.
