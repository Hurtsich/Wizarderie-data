# Master Sculptor Kaelen - Fleshbinder Prime

## Role
Major Antagonist (Leader of the Fleshbinders Guild)

## Physical Description
Tall and unnervingly symmetrical, Kaelen's own body is a canvas of subtle, perfected flesh-binding. Skin is flawless porcelain white, eyes are mismatched (one reptilian, one insectoid), hands possess extra, surgically precise digits. Wears immaculate, sterile robes often stained with exotic ichors.

## Background
- **Origin:** A disillusioned pre-Fall surgeon or bio-artist who saw the Godfall not as an end, but as the ultimate source of new materials for 'creation'.
- **Significant Events:**
  - Pioneered advanced flesh-binding techniques using divine ichor.
  - Established the Fleshbinders Guild as a secretive power.
  - Created numerous infamous 'masterpieces' (living weapons, augmented agents).
  - Currently obsessed with acquiring specific divine materials for a grand project.
- **Relationships:**
  - Fleshbinders Guild Members: Apprentices/Tools (Demands perfection)
  - Prophet Malakor: Professional Disdain/Rivalry (Sees Rot Cult methods as crude)
  - Shard Covenant: Transactional Relationship (Buys materials, sells services)
  - Keepers of the Echo: Contempt (Views them as backward-looking fools)
  - Agent Silus: Cautious Client/Potential Manipulator
- **Secrets:**
  - Kaelen's 'perfection' requires constant, painful maintenance and rare ichors.
  - The Guild kidnaps individuals with unique biological traits for 'raw materials'.
  - Kaelen's ultimate goal is not just crafting monsters, but achieving a form of biological godhood by integrating the essence of multiple dead gods.
  - Has a hidden laboratory performing highly unethical experiments, possibly beneath Shard City or in the Ichorfen Marshes.

## Motivations
- Push the boundaries of biological science and art.

## Connections

- Various Settlements: Source of 'materials' and location of hidden labs

## Development Potential
Could become more monstrous as they augment themselves further. Might be betrayed by an ambitious apprentice (like Fleshbinder Marrow). Could achieve their goal, becoming a demigod-level threat, or have their creations turn against them.

## Reaction to Players
Views players as potential materials, clients, or nuisances. Intrigued by unique mutations or abilities. Might offer augmentation or hire them for dangerous material acquisition. If opposed, sends increasingly deadly biological horrors after them. Dissects failures with cold curiosity.
