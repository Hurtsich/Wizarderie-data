# Prophet Malakor - Herald of the Bloated God

## Role
Major Antagonist (Leader of the Rot Cult of Atherius)

## Physical Description
Gaunt figure draped in rotting finery, skin disturbingly moist and discolored with fungal growths. One eye is milky white, the other burns with feverish intensity. Carries a staff made of fused bone and pulsating organic matter. Smells faintly of decay and damp earth.

## Background
- **Origin:** A former physician from Atheria who lost his family during the Godfall and descended into madness listening to the whispers beneath the city, particularly those attributed to 'Atherius'.
- **Significant Events:**
  - Survived the fall of Atheria.
  - Received 'enlightenment' from the whispers of Atherius.
  - Founded the Rot Cult, gathering followers among the desperate and mad.
  - Orchestrated the Whispering Plague (potential campaign start) to expand influence or perform a ritual.
- **Relationships:**
  - Atherius (Dead God/Influence): Worshipped Deity/Source of Power
  - Rot Cultists: Fanatical Followers (Views them as tools and potential hosts)
  - Master Sculptor Kaelen: Rivalry/Professional Curiosity (Different approach to divine matter)
  - Commander Elara: Primary Opposition (Hunts the Cult)
  - Rot Valerius (Dissident): Former follower, potential betrayer
- **Secrets:**
  - Secretly terrified of Atherius consuming him entirely, losing his identity.
  - May be unknowingly influenced or manipulated by the Unseen Hand who see his cult as a useful tool for chaos.
  - His original physician knowledge is sometimes used to refine poisons or plagues, or even to 'bless' followers with specific mutations.
  - He seeks the 'Heart of Atherius', believing it will grant him control, not just communion.

## Personality
- **Traits:**
  - Charismatic (in a disturbing way)
  - Obsessed
  - Nihilistic
  - Patient
  - Highly Intelligent
  - Utterly Ruthless
  - Delusional
- **Values:**
  - Decay as Transformation and Rebirth
  - Communion through Rot
  - The 'Will' of Atherius
  - Destruction of the 'failed' Old Order
  - Purity through Putrescence
- **Fears:**
  - Silence/Absence of Atherius's whispers
  - True Death (Oblivion without transformation)
  - Losing control of the Cult or Atherius's 'gifts'
  - The Silent Pilgrims' methods
- **Desires:**
  - Achieve perfect communion with Atherius
  - Transform the world into Atherius's 'garden'
  - Attain immortality through unending decay and regeneration
  - Be recognized as the true prophet of the new age

## Motivations
- Spread the influence and 'blessings' of Atherius.
- Achieve personal apotheosis through merging with decay.
- Punish the world that took his family by 'remaking' it in Atherius's image.

## Goals
- Expand the Rot Cult's territory and numbers, controlling key ichor sources.
- Find and control the 'Heart of Atherius' artifact.
- Perform rituals to amplify Atherius's whispers and influence.
- Convert or destroy key locations like Echo Bastion or settlements resisting the rot.
- Undermine rival factions like the Keepers and Fleshbinders.

## Connections
- Rot Cult of Atherius: Founder and Leader
- Atheria / Corpsefall Plains: Base of Operations / Holy Site
- Umbral Deep: Hidden ritual sites / Escape routes
- Keepers of the Echo: Primary Enemy
- Ichorfen Marshes: Source of specific ichor types

## Development Potential
Could become more powerful but less coherent as Atherius's influence grows. Might be redeemed (highly unlikely), overthrown by a subordinate (like Rot Valerius), become a monstrous avatar of decay, or even reveal Atherius's whispers come from somewhere else.

## Reaction to Players
Initially dismissive or attempts to convert them with promises of power or release from suffering. If opposed, views them as ignorant obstacles or diseased tissue to be excised or decayed. Might offer power in exchange for service if he sees potential for corruption or usefulness.
