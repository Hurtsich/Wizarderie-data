Younger person, showing early signs of mutation (discolored skin, weeping eye) but trying to hide it. Looks malnourished and terrified. Wears ill-fitting cult rags. May bear a Valerius family resemblance, suggesting a fallen line.

  - Potential rescuers (Players): Hope/Fear
- **Secrets:**
  - Knows the location of a hidden cult shrine or meeting place.
  - Witnessed a specific crime or atrocity committed by the cult.
  - Stole something minor but potentially incriminating from the cult.

## Motivations
- Escape the Rot Cult before they are punished or fully transformed.
