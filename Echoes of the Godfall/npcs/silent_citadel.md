# Silent Citadel - Citadel Hermit

## Role
Supporting NPC (Watcher at Godsbane Citadel)

Ancient, skeletal figure barely clinging to life. Skin like parchment stretched over bone. Eyes are clouded but seem to see more than physical forms. Dressed in rags that might once have been Silent Pilgrim robes.

- **Significant Events:**
  - Travelled to the desolate Marrow Wastes and reached Godsbane Citadel.
  - Has survived alone near the Citadel for decades, perhaps sustained by its strange energies.
  - Witnessed phenomena related to the Citadel's history or lingering power.
- **Relationships:**
  - Godsbane Citadel: Home / Prison / Place of Meditation
  - Silent Pilgrims: Past connection? / Philosophical divergence?
  - Marrow Wastes: Immediate environment
- **Secrets:**
  - Knows secrets about Godsbane Citadel's purpose or the entity that fell there.
  - Their 'Silence' is different from the Pilgrim doctrine, perhaps closer to true void.
  - May be a guardian of sorts, intentionally or unintentionally.
  - Communicates non-verbally or through cryptic riddles.

## Personality

## Development Potential
Could be a source of vital, cryptic information about the Silent War or the Citadel. Might be a gatekeeper to a deeper secret. Could mistake the players for threats or chosen ones. Might finally dissipate or reveal their true nature.

## Reaction to Players
Ignores them initially. If approached with respect and quiet contemplation, might offer cryptic clues or tests. Reacts negatively to aggression, loud noises, or attempts to exploit the Citadel. May perceive psychic characters differently.
