## Prerequisites
- Completion of 'The Maddening Chorus' or equivalent starting lead

## Objectives
### Navigate to the Source Location

**Success Conditions:**
- Successfully traverse the dangers of Atheria ruins or Umbral Deep.
- Follow clues (energy readings, cult trails) to the suspected focal point.
- Avoid becoming lost or overwhelmed by environmental hazards/echoes.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Party suffers heavy resource depletion or casualties during travel.
- Lose the trail due to hazards or misdirection.
- Alert main antagonists to approach prematurely.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover a hidden route bypassing some dangers (perhaps via Umbral Hand's map fragment?).
- Find evidence of another faction's interest in the source (Unseen Hand?).
### Identify and Analyze the Source

**Success Conditions:**
- Locate the precise source (e.g., Rot Cult ritual site, pulsing Skygrave shard, pre-Fall psychic amplifier).
- Understand its basic function and connection to the plague.
- Assess the immediate guardians (Rot Cultists, mutated creatures).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Misidentify the source's nature or function.
- Trigger a trap or unforeseen effect upon discovery.
- Unable to bypass initial defenses/guardians.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Source is more complex/powerful than anticipated.
- Source seems to have a rudimentary consciousness (artifact/shard).
- Find records detailing the source's origin or purpose.
### Confront the Guardians / Deal with the Source

**Success Conditions:**
- Defeat or bypass the primary guardians (likely Prophet Malakor or his chosen champions).
- Neutralize the source of the Whispering Plague (destroy, contain, disrupt).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Party is defeated by guardians.
- Source remains active or its activation completes.
- Action taken inadvertently worsens the situation (e.g., unstable explosion, wider plague dispersal).

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Capture Prophet Malakor or key lieutenant.
- Destroy the source completely.
- Contain the source (e.g., using Keeper tech if allied).
- Attempt to harness the source's power (risky).
- Source is taken by a third party (Unseen Hand?) during the conflict.
