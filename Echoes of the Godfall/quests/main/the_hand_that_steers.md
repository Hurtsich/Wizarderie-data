# The Hand That Steers

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Main Story Quest (Arc 2)
- **Difficulty:** Medium-High
- **Estimated Duration:** 3-4 sessions

## Description
Beneath the surface of Shard City's politics and trade wars, a hidden player pulls the strings. Uncover the machinations of the Unseen Hand, identify their agents like the elusive Silus, and thwart their local plot before their manipulations trigger a catastrophe, potentially involving shard instability.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of 'The Gilded Cage'/'Flesh and Shard'
- Accumulated clues suggesting hidden manipulation (e.g., unexplained events, coded messages, suspicious figures)

## Objectives
### Identify Unseen Hand Influence

**Success Conditions:**
- Connect seemingly unrelated incidents (assassinations, policy changes, sabotage) to a single hidden actor.
- Identify coded messages or symbols used by the Hand.
- Pinpoint individuals acting suspiciously or under duress.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Misinterpret clues, blaming the wrong faction.
- Alert the Unseen Hand to the investigation prematurely.
- Key evidence is destroyed or obfuscated.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover the Hand is manipulating multiple factions (Covenant, Guild).
- Find evidence suggesting the Hand's interest in a specific artifact or location within the city.
- Receive cryptic warnings from an unknown source about the Hand.
### Unmask a Local Agent (Agent Silus?)

**Success Conditions:**
- Gather sufficient evidence to identify a key Unseen Hand agent operating in Shard City (likely Agent Silus).
- Learn their immediate objective (e.g., acquire specific shard, destabilize Covenant, steal research).
- Survive attempts by the agent to obstruct or eliminate the investigation.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Agent detects investigation and disappears or frames the players.
- Attack by Hand assassins.
- Evidence gathered is circumstantial or deniable.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Agent attempts to recruit the players.
- Agent reveals partial truths to mislead the party.
- Discover the agent has deeply infiltrated the Shard Covenant or another faction.
### Prevent or Mitigate the Hand's Climax / Shardfall

**Success Conditions:**
- Intervene to stop the Unseen Hand's immediate plot (e.g., theft, assassination, sabotage).
- If a shard-related catastrophe is triggered (Shardfall), successfully mitigate the damage, save key NPCs, or contain the fallout.
- Expose the Hand's involvement to relevant parties (optional).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Unseen Hand successfully achieves their local goal.
- Shardfall incident causes widespread destruction and chaos.
- Players are caught in the disaster or framed for it.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Capture or eliminate the Hand agent.
- Recover the artifact/data targeted by the Hand.
- Exploit the chaos of the Shardfall for personal gain or to help a faction.
- The incident reveals a deeper truth about shard nature or the Hand's long-term plans.

## Key NPCs
- Agent Silus
- Councilor Jin
- Shard Valerius
- Master Sculptor Kaelen (potentially involved/affected)
- Silent Hand (potential source of info)

## Key Locations
- Shard City Valerius (various districts, Covenant HQs, power conduits)
- The Veiled Market (information, Hand contacts)
- Marrow Wastes (if related to shard source/instability)
- Hidden Unseen Hand safe house/operational base

## Rewards

- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Unseen Hand: ---
  - Shard Covenant: +/- depending on handling of incident/exposure
  - Fleshbinders Guild: +/- depending on incident cause/effect

## Branching Paths
- Expose the Unseen Hand publicly vs Use the information covertly.
- Focus on stopping the plot vs Saving lives during the catastrophe.
- Ally with a Covenant faction during the chaos vs Act independently.
- Attempt to capture Agent Silus vs Ensure their elimination.

## Optional Content
- Track down and raid an Unseen Hand safe house.
- Protect specific NPCs targeted by the Hand.
- Investigate the exact cause of shard instability leading to the incident.
- Use the incident as cover for another objective (e.g., theft from Covenant vaults).
