- **Type:** Main Story Quest (Arc 3)
- **Difficulty:** High
- **Estimated Duration:** 3-4 sessions

## Description
Brave the hazardous Marrow Wastes, a desert formed from divine bone dust, to reach the legendary Godsbane Citadel. Legends claim this is where a god truly died during the Silent War. Confront ancient defenses, psychic residue, and perhaps the Silent Citadel hermit to uncover truths about the Godfall.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Arc 2
- Lead pointing towards Godsbane Citadel (ancient text, Unseen Hand interest, prophecy)

## Objectives
### Traverse the Marrow Wastes

**Success Conditions:**
- Successfully navigate the Shifting Bone Dunes.
- Survive environmental hazards like bonedust storms and skeletal aberrations.
- Locate the hidden or well-guarded Godsbane Citadel.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Become lost in the wastes.
- Suffer heavy losses from environmental hazards or creatures.
- Alert guardians to approach from afar.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Find remnants of failed expeditions.
- Encounter unique creatures formed from bonedust.

### Breach Godsbane Citadel

**Success Conditions:**
- Find a way past the Citadel's ancient, cyclopean defenses (physical or energetic).

- Overwhelmed by internal guardians or energy fields.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- The Silent Citadel hermit offers cryptic guidance or poses a trial.
- Discover evidence of previous visitors (Unseen Hand? Early Pilgrims?).
- Find that the Citadel itself seems sentient or reactive.
### Uncover the Citadel's Secret

**Success Conditions:**
- Reach the heart of the Citadel (impact site, sealed vault, resonance chamber).
- Witness or decipher revelations about the Silent War, the nature of the god who fell there, or the origins of the Godfall itself.
- Survive any final guardians or psychic backlash from the revelation.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Secret remains inaccessible or incomprehensible.
- Revelation triggers a dangerous event or attracts unwanted attention.
- Final guardians prove insurmountable.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- The 'secret' is a powerful artifact, a living echo, or a direct link to the Void.
- Discover evidence contradicting established history.
- Learn about a weapon used in the Silent War.
- Gain insight into the Unseen Hand's true origins or goals if they sought this place.
