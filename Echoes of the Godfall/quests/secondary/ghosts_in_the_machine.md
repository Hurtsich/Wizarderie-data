# Ghosts in the Machine

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Faction Quest (Keepers of the Echo) / Technical Investigation
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Estimated Duration:** Medium (1-2 sessions)

## Description
Echo Bastion's sophisticated Echo-Detection Systems are malfunctioning, reporting phantom echoes, false positives, and blind spots. Commander Elara suspects sabotage, environmental interference, or something stranger. She needs technically-minded individuals to diagnose the problem.

## Prerequisites
- Neutral or higher reputation with Keepers
- Technical skills (mechanics, electronics) or psychic sensitivity

## Objectives
### Receive briefing from Commander Elara and tech specialist Echo Umbral.

**Success Conditions:**
- Understand the system's layout and symptoms.
- Gain access to diagnostic tools and relevant system junctions.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Briefing is insufficient.
- Access denied due to lack of trust or skills.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Echo Umbral provides speculative theories (sabotage, psychic interference, nesting creatures).
### Inspect key components of the Echo-Detection System within Echo Bastion.

**Success Conditions:**
- Check sensors, relays, and processing units.
- Identify physical damage, environmental interference, or anomalous readings.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Unable to access critical system areas.
- Misdiagnose based on superficial checks.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Find evidence of tampering (cut wires, foreign objects).
- Detect unusual energy fields or psychic resonance near components.
### Analyze diagnostic reports and system logs.

**Success Conditions:**
- Identify patterns in the malfunctions.
- Cross-reference logs with reported phantom echoes.
- Isolate the source of the problem (hardware failure, software glitch, external interference).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Logs are corrupted or wiped.
- Data is too complex to interpret.
- Patterns are inconsistent or misleading.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover hidden subroutines or backdoors in the system software (Unseen Hand?).
- Logs indicate the system is detecting something real but previously unknown.
### Report the diagnosis and potential solutions to Elara and Echo Umbral.

**Success Conditions:**
- Provide a clear explanation of the malfunction's cause.
- Recommend repair procedures, countermeasures, or further investigation.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Diagnosis is incorrect, leading to failed repairs.
- Solution is too complex or resource-intensive.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- The cause is revealed to be a nascent machine intelligence or a trapped echo within the system.
- Evidence points towards an inside saboteur.

## Key NPCs
- Commander Elara (Quest Giver)
- Echo Umbral (Technical Expert/Support)

## Key Locations
- Echo Bastion (Control Rooms, Sensor Towers, Maintenance Tunnels)

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Customized piece of Keeper Tech Gear (e.g., handheld echo detector, energy weapon mod).
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Payment in Keeper resources.
  - Access codes for certain Bastion areas.
  - Favorable reputation with Echo Umbral for future tech needs.
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - Fragment of code hinting at Unseen Hand infiltration.
  - Map of Echo Bastion's internal systems.
  - Ability to temporarily disable/manipulate the detection system.
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Keepers of the Echo: Positive

## Branching Paths
- Focus on physical inspection vs. Software analysis vs. Psychic investigation (if applicable).
- Report suspicions of sabotage immediately vs. Gather more proof.
- Attempt field repairs vs. Recommend specialized parts/personnel.
- If sabotage found, decide who to report to (Elara directly, internal security?).

## Optional Content
- Optimize system performance beyond just fixing the malfunction.
- Set traps for potential saboteurs.
- Use the system access to scan for hidden compartments or surveillance devices within the Bastion.
