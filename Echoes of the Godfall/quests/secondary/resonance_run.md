# Resonance Run

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Faction Quest (Keepers of the Echo) / Collection
- **Difficulty:** Easy-Medium
- **Estimated Duration:** Short (1 session)

## Description
Keeper Atheria needs fresh samples of psychic resonance from the Corpsefall Plains, specifically near areas where echoes manifest strongly or where ichor from 'The Watcher' falls heavily. Brave the hazardous plains, collect the volatile samples, and return them before they destabilize.

## Prerequisites
- Access to Echo Bastion
- Basic survival gear for Corpsefall Plains

## Objectives
### Travel to designated high-resonance zones in the Corpsefall Plains.

**Success Conditions:**
- Reach at least 2 of the 3 marked zones.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Become lost or incapacitated by environmental hazards (ichor geysers, mutated herds).

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover an unmarked resonance zone.
### Collect resonance samples using Keeper-provided collectors.

**Success Conditions:**
- Successfully collect stable samples from 2 zones.
- Avoid direct confrontation with strong echoes while collecting.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Sample collectors are damaged.
- Samples destabilize due to improper handling or combat.
- Collectors overload from excessive resonance.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Collect an unusually potent or strange resonance sample.
### Return the samples to Keeper Atheria at Echo Bastion within the time limit.

**Success Conditions:**
