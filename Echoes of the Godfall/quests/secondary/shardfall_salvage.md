# Shardfall Salvage

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Exploration / Timed Quest
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Estimated Duration:** Short (1 session)

## Description
A fragment broke off a Skygrave and crashed into the Corpsefall Plains relatively intact. The eccentric salvager Skygrave Shard wants to hire skilled individuals to help extract valuable crystalline structures and stable divine matter before Shard Covenant patrols inevitably lock down the site.

## Prerequisites
- Willingness to work with Skygrave Shard
- Ability to traverse Corpsefall Plains

## Objectives
### Reach the Skygrave fragment crash site with Skygrave Shard.

**Success Conditions:**
- Arrive at the crash site before any Covenant patrols.
- Avoid major hazards en route.

**Failure Conditions:**

- Party is incapacitated en route.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover other independent scavengers already at the site.
### Harvest valuable crystalline structures and stable divine matter.

**Success Conditions:**
- Collect a quota of target materials within the time limit.
- Avoid triggering environmental hazards on the unstable fragment (variable gravity, energy discharges).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Time runs out before quota is met.
- Harvesting triggers a catastrophic collapse or energy release.
- Materials harvested are unstable or low quality.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover a unique or unusually potent artifact within the fragment.
- Encounter hostile Skygrave flora/fauna that survived the crash.
### Evade or neutralize competing scavengers or arriving Shard Covenant patrols.

- Escape the site with the harvested materials before being captured or forced to abandon the goods.

- Captured by the Shard Covenant.
- Materials confiscated.
- Forced to flee without the harvested goods.
