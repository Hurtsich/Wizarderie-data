## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Exploration / Mystery

## Description
Traders near Bleak Harbor report increasingly frequent and virulent toxic spore clouds drifting from the Ichorfen Marshes. Exposure causes rapid mutation, horrifying hallucinations, and violent madness. Investigate the source of these intensified spore clouds.

## Prerequisites
- Access to Bleak Harbor or Ichorfen Marshes
- Protection against toxic environments

## Objectives
### Gather information in Bleak Harbor about the spore clouds.

**Success Conditions:**
- Interview witnesses (like Harbor Rot).
- Map the general drift patterns and locations of recent sightings.
- Obtain descriptions of the effects.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Unable to find reliable witnesses.
- Information gathered is contradictory or misleading.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Hear rumors linking the spores to specific marsh landmarks or creatures.
### Track the spore clouds back to their source within the Ichorfen Marshes.

**Success Conditions:**
- Identify the origin point of the intensified spore clouds (e.g., a new fungal bloom, mutated creature nest, ichor pool interaction).
- Navigate the marshes safely using protective gear.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Succumb to spore exposure.
- Unable to pinpoint the specific source amidst the generally toxic environment.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover multiple potential sources.
### Determine the cause of the intensified spore release.

**Success Conditions:**
- Identify the specific fungus/creature/phenomenon responsible.
- Understand why it has become more active or virulent recently (e.g., ichor shift, mutation, external influence).
