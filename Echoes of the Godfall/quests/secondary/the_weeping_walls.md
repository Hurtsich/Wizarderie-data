# The Weeping Walls

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Faction Quest (Keepers of the Echo) / Investigation
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Estimated Duration:** Medium (1-2 sessions)

## Description
Strange, flesh-like fungi are rapidly growing over sections of the Atheria ruins, seeming to absorb and amplify sorrow, driving nearby scavengers to despair and madness. Investigate the source and nature of these 'Weeping Walls' for the Keepers, suspecting Rot Cult involvement.

## Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with Atheria
- Reputation Neutral or higher with Keepers of the Echo

## Objectives
### Locate the primary clusters of the Weeping Walls fungus in Atheria.

**Success Conditions:**
- Identify and reach at least 3 major fungal clusters.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Become overwhelmed by amplified despair/madness.
- Attract overwhelming Rot Cult attention.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover a hidden Rot Cult shrine nurturing the fungus.
### Analyze the fungus and its effects.

**Success Conditions:**
- Collect viable samples.
- Observe its effect on scavengers or echoes.
- Determine its connection to psychic phenomena or ichor types.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Samples become inert or dangerously reactive.
- Incorrectly diagnose the effect.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Develop a temporary resistance or vulnerability to its effects.
### Identify the source or cultivator (likely Rot Cult).

**Success Conditions:**
- Find evidence linking the fungus to the Rot Cult (symbols, tools, witnesses like Corpsefall).
- Identify a specific cultist or ritual responsible.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Misidentify the source.
- Alert the cultivators, allowing them to escape or destroy evidence.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover the fungus is a semi-natural phenomenon amplified by the Rot Cult, not fully created by them.
### Neutralize the primary source or halt the spread.

**Success Conditions:**
- Destroy the central cultivating ritual/shrine.
- Find and apply a specific counter-agent (perhaps derived from pre-Fall fungicide or specific ichor type).
- Disrupt the cultists responsible.

**Failure Conditions:**
- The fungus spreads further.
- The neutralization attempt backfires, potentially creating a worse hazard.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Contain the fungus instead of destroying it.
- Convince the involved cultist (like Corpsefall) to abandon the project.
