# Echoes of the Shattered Grid: Campaign Design Document

## Campaign Overview

**Concept:** *Echoes of the Shattered Grid* is an RPG campaign set centuries after 'The Great Dimming', a cataclysm that shattered civilization, choked the land with radioactive 'Glowlands', and induced widespread mutations known as 'Twists'. Modern technology is forgotten, its remnants ('Tech-Magic') viewed as powerful, often dangerous magical relics. Players navigate this broken world, uncovering fragments of the past and becoming embroiled in a conflict over the 'Whispering Core' – a dispersed network of pre-Dimming data archives and automated systems holding immense power and forgotten knowledge.

**Logline:** In a mutated world rebuilding atop the ruins of a forgotten technological age, players unearth fragments of the past, seeking power and truth amidst warring factions vying for control of 'Tech-Magic' – remnants of a civilization that may hold the key to salvation or repeat its devastating mistakes.

**Central Conflict:** The race to locate and control nodes of the Whispering Core network pits several factions against each other and the players:
*   **The Lumen Covenant:** Zealots worshipping the 'Ancients', seeking 'Keys' to activate the Core for a prophesied paradise.
*   **The Rust Lords:** Brutal warlords seeking the Core's 'Tech-Magic' purely as weaponry to dominate the wastes.
*   **The Keepers of Static:** Secretive saboteurs believing the Core's knowledge caused the Dimming and must remain dormant or be destroyed.
*   **The Players:** Initially driven by personal needs, they become central figures deciding the Core's fate.

**Mood:** A blend of **Grit** (survival focus, scarce resources, hostile environment), **Wonder** (awe-inspiring discovery of functional Tech-Magic), and **Unease** (realization of tech's dangers, the past's lingering poison, moral ambiguity).

**Primary Themes:**
1.  **Legacy & The Danger of the Past:** Exploring the consequences of past actions and the risk of repeating mistakes through rediscovered technology.
2.  **Rediscovery vs. Misinterpretation:** The core of 'Tech-Magic'; players deciphering true functions while NPCs use tech based on superstition.
3.  **The Nature of Humanity & Adaptation:** Examining survival, community, prejudice ('Twists'), and morality in a changed world.
4.  **Truth vs. Myth:** Uncovering the often grim reality behind legends of the Before Times and the Great Dimming.

*   **Elara's Nature:** She is an AI projection, host, or hybrid.
*   **Faction is Right (Twisted):** One faction's core belief is accidentally true but misinterpreted (e.g., Covenant prophecies are garbled AI predictions).

## Player Choice Impact

Player decisions significantly shape the narrative:
*   **Tech Handling:** Experimentation vs. caution affects outcomes, risks, and faction attention. Understanding true function provides advantages.
*   **Faction Entanglement:** Alliances, rivalries, and reputation are built through interaction, affecting available aid, information, and enemies. Playing factions against each other is possible but risky.
*   **Information Brokerage:** Sharing or hiding discoveries impacts faction dynamics, NPC reactions, and public perception. Spreading misinformation has consequences.
*   **The Key Quest:** Method of acquiring Keys (diplomacy, stealth, force) shifts alliances. Using, trading, or destroying Keys has major repercussions.
*   **Keeper Relations:** Fighting, negotiating, or allying with Keepers grants different advantages and disadvantages, impacting access to information and other faction relations.
*   **Node Interaction:** Careful vs. reckless activation of Core systems determines results, risks catastrophic failures, or reveals hidden functions.
*   **Truth Management:** How players handle shocking revelations influences faction stability, alliances, and NPC trust.
*   **Endgame Alliances:** Past choices determine who stands with/against players in the final confrontation.
*   **Nexus Navigation:** Tactical use of Core systems during the finale can turn the tide.
*   **The Final Decision:** Directly determines the campaign epilogue, the fate of the region, factions, and key NPCs.
