*   **One Minor Action:** Draw/stow a weapon, open/close a door, speak a short phrase, interact with a simple object, activate a simple gadget feature.
*   **Movement:** Move up to your Speed (typically 30 feet). Can be broken up before/after actions.
*   **One Reaction:** Used outside your turn in response to a trigger (e.g., Opportunity Attack when an enemy leaves your reach, casting a reaction spell).

## 2. Combat System

### Structure

*   **Initiative:** At the start of combat, everyone rolls a d20 + DEX modifier. The results determine the turn order, highest to lowest.
*   **Turns:** Combat proceeds in rounds. On your turn, you take actions as per the Action Economy.
*   **Surprise:** If unaware of enemies, a character might be Surprised and unable to act on their first turn. Determined by GM based on Stealth vs. Perception.

### Actions in Combat

*   **Attack:** Make a melee or ranged attack roll (d20 + STR/DEX Mod + Proficiency Bonus) against the target's AC. On a hit, roll damage.
*   **Cast Spell:** Use a Standard Action (usually) to cast a spell. Requires concentration, components, or other resources as defined by the spell.
*   **Use Gadget:** Activate a technological device. May require a Standard or Minor action, potentially a skill check (e.g., Mechanics), and might consume charges/fuel.
*   **Defend:** Use a Standard Action to take the Dodge action, improving your defenses.
*   **Move:** Use your movement speed. Difficult terrain costs double movement. Standing up from prone costs half your movement.

### Damage & Defense

*   **Armor Class (AC):** Represents how hard you are to hit.
    *   **AC = 10 + Armor Bonus + Dexterity Modifier (up to armor's max DEX bonus) + Shield Bonus + Other Modifiers.**
*   **Hit Points (HP):** Represents your health and resilience. Determined by origin/class and CON modifier. Reaches 0 HP = unconscious and dying. Reaches negative HP equal to max HP = dead.
*   **Damage Types:**
    *   **Physical:** Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing (non-magical weapons, impacts).
    *   **Fire:** Flames, heat.
    *   **Frost:** Ice, cold.
    *   **Electrical:** Lightning, galvanic energy.
    *   **Arcane:** Raw magical energy, force effects.
    *   **Clockwork/Force:** Damage from crushing gears, steam pressure, kinetic impacts from Artifice.
    *   **Poison/Acid:** Corrosive or toxic substances.
*   **Resistance/Vulnerability:** Some creatures/armor might resist (take half damage) or be vulnerable (take double damage) to certain types.

### Critical Hits / Fumbles

*   **Critical Hit (Natural 20):** Rolling a 20 on an attack roll automatically hits. Roll double the damage dice for the attack.
    *   *Steampunk Flair:* A critical hit with a Steam Hammer might knock the target prone from the impact; a Galvanic Pistol crit might cause lingering electrical arcs (minor ongoing damage).
*   **Critical Fumble (Natural 1):** Rolling a 1 on an attack roll automatically misses. The GM may introduce a minor complication.
    *   *Steampunk Flair:* A fumble with a Clockwork Crossbow might jam the loading mechanism (requires Minor Action to clear); a fumble using a complex Gadget might cause it to sputter, malfunction temporarily, or consume extra fuel/charge. *Avoid overly punishing fumbles.*

### Steampunk Weapons (Examples)

*   **Steam Hammer (Melee):** Heavy, requires STR. Deals high Bludgeoning/Force damage. Might have a 'Vent Steam' feature (Minor Action) for a small burst of area damage or knockback.
*   **Clockwork Crossbow (Ranged):** Uses DEX. Fires bolts (Piercing). May have an auto-loading mechanism allowing multiple shots (potentially as one Standard Action, or reducing reload time). Prone to jamming on a fumble.
*   **Galvanic Pistol (Ranged):** Uses DEX. Deals Electrical damage. Range might be shorter than a standard pistol. Requires energy cells or winding.
*   **Pneumatic Gauntlet (Melee):** Uses STR. Deals Bludgeoning/Force damage. Can be used to grapple with advantage.
*   **Alchemical Sprayer (Ranged):** Uses DEX. Fires cones or lines of alchemical substances (Acid, Fire, Adhesive). Limited shots per canister.

## 3. Magic and Technology

### Spellcasting (Old Power)

*   **Source:** Drawing upon the ambient magical energies of the world or specific pacts/traditions (e.g., Valorian elementalism, Eldwood nature spirits).
*   **Resource:** **Mana Points (MP).** Calculated based on level and Wisdom modifier (e.g., MP = 4 + Level + WIS Mod). Spells cost MP to cast. MP regenerates during rests (e.g., half on short rest, full on long rest).
*   **Casting:** Requires a Standard Action (usually), concentration for some spells, and potentially verbal/somatic/material components. Spellcasters know a certain number of spells and can prepare a subset each day (GM determines specifics based on character concept).
*   **Spellcasting Ability:** Wisdom is typically used for Old Power spellcasting checks and determining spell save DCs (DC = 8 + Proficiency Bonus + WIS Mod).
*   **Example Spells:**
    *   *Flicker (Cantrip):* Create a small flame or spark.
    *   *Mend Wood (Level 1):* Repair simple wooden objects (Valorian/Eldwood).
    *   *Stone Shield (Level 1):* Briefly increase AC by conjuring earthen protection (Valorian).
    *   *Entangling Vines (Level 1):* Restrain creatures in an area with magical plants (Eldwood).
    *   *Static Discharge (Level 1):* Zap a target with minor Electrical damage (Valorian Storm Magic).

### Gadgeteering / Artifice (New Power)

*   **Source:** Applying principles of mechanics, alchemy, steam power, and clockwork to create devices. Primarily associated with Cogsworth and Artificers.
*   **Crafting:** Requires time, resources (scrap, components, fuel), appropriate tools (Tinker's Tools, Alchemist's Supplies), and a successful **Mechanics (INT)** check. DC depends on complexity. Failure might waste resources or create a flawed device.
*   **Usage:** Gadgets often have limited uses (**Charges** or **Fuel**). Using a gadget might require a Standard or Minor Action.
*   **Malfunction:** On a critical fumble (Natural 1) when using a complex gadget, or sometimes when pushed beyond limits (GM discretion), it might malfunction. Roll on a simple table (e.g., 1-2: Depleted, needs repair/refuel; 3-4: Jammed, needs Minor Action; 5: Minor explosion/backfire, user takes minimal damage; 6: Breaks completely).
*   **Gadgeteering Ability:** Intellect is typically used for crafting and understanding technology.
*   **Example Gadgets:**
    *   *Clockwork Owl:* Provides scouting, delivers messages. Limited operational time per winding (Charges). Requires Mechanics check to build.
    *   *Grappling Hook Launcher:* Fires a hook and line. Requires DEX check to aim, STR check to climb. Uses compressed air/steam (Fuel).
    *   *Alchemical Grenade (Acid/Fire/Smoke):* Thrown weapon, area effect. Consumed on use. Requires Alchemy check to craft.
    *   *Steam-Assisted Actuators (Armor Mod):* Increases Strength score or carrying capacity temporarily. Consumes steam pressure (Fuel). Requires Mechanics check to install.

### Arcanomechanics (Syncretist Guild)

*   **Source:** The deliberate fusion of Old Power magic with New Power technology.
*   **Mechanics:** Often involves enchanting technological components or using magical energy to power devices. Requires proficiency in both **Spellcraft** and **Mechanics**.
*   **Crafting:** Requires rare materials (e.g., magically resonant crystals, enchanted metals), specific rituals or blueprints, and successful checks in both skills (often with high DCs).
*   **Usage:** Arcanomechanical devices might use Mana Points, special arcane charges, or have unique activation methods. They can often replicate spell effects or achieve results neither magic nor tech alone could manage.
*   **Example Arcanomechanics:**
    *   *Magically Charged Power Cell:* Stores MP that can be used to power certain gadgets or release as raw energy. Requires Spellcraft (INT or WIS) to charge.
    *   *Enchanted Clockwork Limb:* Replaces a lost limb, functions like a normal limb but might have minor magical enhancements (e.g., resistance to cold, slightly increased STR). Requires attunement.
    *   *Elemental Steam Engine:* An airship engine infused with an air or fire elemental, providing greater speed or efficiency but potentially unstable. Requires specific rituals to bind/maintain.
    *   *Runic Targeting Scope:* Attachable to ranged weapons. Uses minor magic (perhaps 1 MP per shot) to grant advantage on the attack roll.

## 4. Optional Systems (Keep Simple)

### Advanced Options (Character Paths)

These represent specialized training or focus beyond basic origins. Gained through leveling or specific story achievements. Provide a small package of thematic abilities or skill proficiencies.

*   **Artificer Specialist:** Gains expertise in Mechanics, learns schematics for advanced gadgets faster, potentially gains a signature clockwork companion.
*   **Eldwood Druid:** Gains ability to Wild Shape into natural beasts, learns more nature-focused Old Power spells, gains proficiency in Nature/Survival.
*   **Gearbreaker Saboteur:** Gains expertise in Stealth and Mechanics (for disabling), proficiency with explosives, advantage on checks to sabotage machinery.
*   **Syncretist Adept:** Gains proficiency in Arcanomechanics (if not already known), learns unique Arcanomechanical crafting recipes, potentially gains ability to channel MP into devices.

### Equipment Customization

*   **Mechanics:** Requires appropriate tools, time, resources (cost determined by GM), and a successful skill check (usually Mechanics or Alchemy). DC based on complexity.
*   **Process:** Player describes desired modification. GM sets DC, cost, and time.
*   **Examples:**
    *   *Adding Scope to Crossbow:* Mechanics DC 13, cost 50 Cogs, 1 hour. Grants +1 to attack rolls at longer ranges.
    *   *Reinforcing Armor Plates:* Mechanics DC 15, cost 100 Cogs + materials, 4 hours. Increases Armor Bonus by +1, might add weight or slightly reduce max DEX bonus.
    *   *Overclocking Steam Engine:* Mechanics DC 16, cost varies, 2 hours. Increases speed/power output temporarily but increases Malfunction chance or fuel consumption. Requires check each time it's pushed.

### Faction Rules

*   **Reputation:** Track reputation with key factions on a simple scale (e.g., -3 Hostile, -2 Unfriendly, -1 Neutral, 0 Indifferent, +1 Friendly, +2 Allied, +3 Revered). Actions in the game adjust these scores.
*   **Benefits:** Positive reputation grants access to benefits:
    *   *+1 Friendly:* Access to faction-specific common gear/information, minor favors.
    *   *+2 Allied:* Access to restricted areas/safe houses, discounts on faction goods/services, potential for faction backup on missions.
    *   *+3 Revered:* Access to rare/powerful faction equipment or secrets, significant political influence within the faction, high-level support.
*   **Drawbacks:** Negative reputation leads to suspicion, hostility, refusal of service, or active opposition from the faction.

## 5. Edge Cases & Examples

1.  **Combat on a Moving Airship:**
    *   **Environment:** The deck is the battlefield. Strong winds might impose disadvantage on ranged attacks or require DEX checks to avoid being blown overboard (DC 10-15 depending on severity/altitude).
    *   **Movement:** Moving on the deck is normal. Climbing rigging requires Athletics checks. Falling overboard is likely fatal unless countermeasures (e.g., Feather Fall spell, grappling hook) are used.
    *   **Ship Actions:** The pilot uses their turn to control the ship (Airship Piloting checks). Damage to critical ship parts (engine, rudder, envelope) can have major consequences (loss of altitude, reduced speed, fire). Large weapons (cannons) might require multiple crew members (actions) to operate.

2.  **Using Artifice to Disable a Magical Ward:**
    *   **Direct Disabling:** Generally, Artifice cannot directly dispel or disable purely magical effects like a ward. Technology operates on physical/mechanical principles, while magic operates on arcane ones.
    *   **Indirect Methods:** Artifice *could* be used indirectly.
        *   **Overload:** A powerful electrical discharge (Galvanic device) or concussive blast (Alchemical grenade) *might* temporarily disrupt the ward's matrix if the GM rules the ward has a physical anchor or is susceptible to such interference (requires high Mechanics/Alchemy check vs. Spell Save DC of the ward). Success might only suppress it for a round or two.
        *   **Bypass:** A gadget might allow bypassing the ward physically (e.g., a device that drills through the warded wall, bypassing the magical barrier on the door).
        *   **Arcanomechanics:** A device specifically designed using Arcanomechanics (e.g., a 'Runic Nullifier') *could* potentially interact with and disable magical wards, likely requiring an Arcanomechanics skill check vs. the ward's Spell Save DC and consuming significant power/charges.

3.  **Combat with a Large Steam-Powered Golem:**
    *   **Scale:** The golem is Large or Huge, granting it advantages (reach, potentially more attacks/damage) but making it an easier target (lower AC due to size, unless heavily armored). It likely has high STR and CON, lots of HP, and potentially damage resistance to physical attacks.
    *   **Targeting:** Players might target specific weak points identified via successful Investigation or Mechanics checks (e.g., hydraulic joints, boiler unit, sensor array). Hitting these might require a 'called shot' (attack at disadvantage or vs. higher AC) but could impose conditions (reduced speed, disable a weapon, cause steam leak).
    *   **Golem Actions:** Might include powerful slams (Bludgeoning/Force), steam vents (Fire damage cone), grappling, or integrated weapons.
    *   **Vulnerabilities:** Likely vulnerable to Electrical damage (shorting circuits) or extreme Cold (making metal brittle). Its boiler might be a critical weak point; rupturing it (perhaps via a critical hit or targeted attack) could cause a massive explosion or disable the golem. Magic like *Heat Metal* could be very effective against its chassis. Artifice might be used to jam joints (Mechanics check) or overload systems."

## Campaign Overview

**Concept:** *Echoes of the Shattered Grid* is an RPG campaign set centuries after 'The Great Dimming', a cataclysm that shattered civilization, choked the land with radioactive 'Glowlands', and induced widespread mutations known as 'Twists'. Modern technology is forgotten, its remnants ('Tech-Magic') viewed as powerful, often dangerous magical relics. Players navigate this broken world, uncovering fragments of the past and becoming embroiled in a conflict over the 'Whispering Core' – a dispersed network of pre-Dimming data archives and automated systems holding immense power and forgotten knowledge.

**Logline:** In a mutated world rebuilding atop the ruins of a forgotten technological age, players unearth fragments of the past, seeking power and truth amidst warring factions vying for control of 'Tech-Magic' – remnants of a civilization that may hold the key to salvation or repeat its devastating mistakes.

**Central Conflict:** The race to locate and control nodes of the Whispering Core network pits several factions against each other and the players:
*   **The Lumen Covenant:** Zealots worshipping the 'Ancients', seeking 'Keys' to activate the Core for a prophesied paradise.
*   **The Rust Lords:** Brutal warlords seeking the Core's 'Tech-Magic' purely as weaponry to dominate the wastes.
*   **The Keepers of Static:** Secretive saboteurs believing the Core's knowledge caused the Dimming and must remain dormant or be destroyed.
*   **The Players:** Initially driven by personal needs, they become central figures deciding the Core's fate.

**Mood:** A blend of **Grit** (survival focus, scarce resources, hostile environment), **Wonder** (awe-inspiring discovery of functional Tech-Magic), and **Unease** (realization of tech's dangers, the past's lingering poison, moral ambiguity).

**Primary Themes:**
1.  **Legacy & The Danger of the Past:** Exploring the consequences of past actions and the risk of repeating mistakes through rediscovered technology.
2.  **Rediscovery vs. Misinterpretation:** The core of 'Tech-Magic'; players deciphering true functions while NPCs use tech based on superstition.
3.  **The Nature of Humanity & Adaptation:** Examining survival, community, prejudice ('Twists'), and morality in a changed world.
4.  **Truth vs. Myth:** Uncovering the often grim reality behind legends of the Before Times and the Great Dimming.

## Campaign Structure

The campaign follows a three-arc structure, escalating from local survival to world-altering decisions.

**Arc 1: Whispers on the Wind (Levels ~1-5)**

*   **Focus:** The race for specific 'Keys' to major Core nodes intensifies. The Keepers of Static emerge. The true nature and dangers of the Core begin to surface.
*   **Key Beats:**
    1.  **The Map Unfolds:** Deciphering clues pointing to a major Core node and the specific 'Key' needed.
    2.  **Echoes of Warning:** Active intervention by the Keepers of Static (sabotage, traps, direct confrontation). Potential discovery of their motives.
    3.  **The Gauntlet Node:** Reaching and navigating a major Core node location (e.g., automated factory, data haven), facing advanced hazards and defenses.
    4.  **Partial Activation & The Shocking Truth:** Gaining limited access reveals a significant, assumption-challenging truth about the Ancients, the Dimming, or the factions' beliefs.

**Arc 3: Echoes of the Ancients (Levels ~11+)**
*   **Focus:** Confronting the heart of the Whispering Core, uncovering the ultimate truth, final faction showdowns, and making a campaign-defining choice.
*   **Key Beats:**
    1.  **Race to the Nexus:** All factions converge on the presumed central Core node or control hub.
    2.  **Inside the Sanctum:** Navigating the ultimate high-tech dungeon, facing apex defenses, corrupted AI, and uncovering the final truth about the Dimming and the Core's purpose.
    3.  **Apex Conflict:** Clashes between faction leaders and elite forces within the Nexus, with players caught in the middle.
    4.  **The Heart of the Core & The Final Choice:** Reaching the control mechanism and making a complex decision with lasting consequences (Destroy, Full Activation, Controlled Harnessing, Contain & Study, Integration/Adaptation, Entrust to AI).

## Key Story Beats (Detailed within Arcs above)

Significant moments include the initial discovery of functional Tech-Magic, first encounters with each major faction, uncovering the existence and legends of the Whispering Core, acquiring 'Keys', confronting the Keepers, activating a Core node and learning a shocking truth, racing to the Core Nexus, surviving the final dungeon, witnessing the faction endgame clash, and making the ultimate choice about the Core's fate.

## Player Hooks (Individual Motivations)

*   **The Marked One:** Unique 'Twist' reacts to Tech-Magic/Core sites. Seeks understanding/cure.
*   **The Heirloom Hunter:** Possesses broken family Tech-Magic artifact linked to the past. Seeks repair/answers.

*   **Greater Threat:** The Core is containing something worse (aliens, nanoplague, etc.). Destroying it unleashes doom.
*   **Elara's Nature:** She is an AI projection, host, or hybrid.
*   **Faction is Right (Twisted):** One faction's core belief is accidentally true but misinterpreted (e.g., Covenant prophecies are garbled AI predictions).

## Player Choice Impact

Player decisions significantly shape the narrative:
*   **Tech Handling:** Experimentation vs. caution affects outcomes, risks, and faction attention. Understanding true function provides advantages.
*   **Faction Entanglement:** Alliances, rivalries, and reputation are built through interaction, affecting available aid, information, and enemies. Playing factions against each other is possible but risky.
*   **Information Brokerage:** Sharing or hiding discoveries impacts faction dynamics, NPC reactions, and public perception. Spreading misinformation has consequences.
*   **The Key Quest:** Method of acquiring Keys (diplomacy, stealth, force) shifts alliances. Using, trading, or destroying Keys has major repercussions.
*   **Keeper Relations:** Fighting, negotiating, or allying with Keepers grants different advantages and disadvantages, impacting access to information and other faction relations.
*   **Node Interaction:** Careful vs. reckless activation of Core systems determines results, risks catastrophic failures, or reveals hidden functions.
*   **Truth Management:** How players handle shocking revelations influences faction stability, alliances, and NPC trust.
*   **Endgame Alliances:** Past choices determine who stands with/against players in the final confrontation.
*   **Nexus Navigation:** Tactical use of Core systems during the finale can turn the tide.
*   **The Final Decision:** Directly determines the campaign epilogue, the fate of the region, factions, and key NPCs.

## The Tapestry of a Broken World: History

**The Before Times (Antiquity - ~300 Years Ago):**
Legends whisper of an age when metal birds soared on silent wings, cities scraped the heavens, and rivers of light flowed through invisible veins, connecting every corner of the world. This was the era of the "Ancients" – humanity at its technological zenith. They commanded forces beyond comprehension, bending reality through intricate devices powered by the "Grid," a global energy and information network. They built colossal structures, mapped the stars, and even manipulated life itself. Yet, pride and unchecked progress cast long shadows. Environmental degradation, resource wars fought with unseen weapons, and the burgeoning complexity of their own creations sowed the seeds of collapse. The Whispering Core, a distributed network of automated systems, data archives, and AI constructs, was their magnum opus – designed to manage their civilization, preserve knowledge, and perhaps even transcend their physical limitations.

**The Great Dimming (~300 Years Ago):**
The exact cause remains shrouded in fragmented data and fearful myth. Some whisper of a solar flare overwhelming the Grid, others of a catastrophic war fought with weapons that poisoned the sky, and still others blame the Ancients' hubris – perhaps the Whispering Core itself, or a rival AI, turning against its creators. What is known is the result: a sudden, cascading failure of the global infrastructure. Lights went out, communications ceased, automated systems malfunctioned or went dormant, and the sky filled with strange energies and falling debris. Coastlines shifted, weather patterns destabilized violently, and vast swathes of land were rendered uninhabitable by intense radiation and chemical contamination – the birth of the "Glowlands." Billions perished in the immediate aftermath through starvation, violence, environmental collapse, and the failure of life-sustaining technologies. Civilization, as the Ancients knew it, ended not with a bang, but with a sudden, terrifying silence.

**The Chaos Years (~300 - 200 Years Ago):**
Survival became the only law. Small pockets of humanity clung to existence amidst the ruins, scavenging dwindling resources and battling mutated wildlife and desperate raiders. Knowledge was lost rapidly; advanced technology, without the infrastructure to support it, became useless junk or dangerous curiosities. The Glowlands expanded, their strange energies warping life, giving rise to the first widespread mutations – the "Twists." These mutations were initially feared and often led to exile or death, breeding deep-seated prejudice. Oral tradition began replacing written records, myths intertwining with fragmented truths about the Before Times.

**The Age of Scars (~200 - 50 Years Ago):**
Slowly, new societies began to coalesce. Settlements formed around defensible ruins or scarce resources like clean water. Rudimentary agriculture, hunting, and scavenging formed the basis of the new economies. Factions emerged from the chaos: warlords carving out territory through brute force (the progenitors of the Rust Lords), communities bound by shared beliefs or survival strategies, and those who sought to understand or control the dangerous remnants of the past. Tech-Magic, the superstitious use and reverence of pre-Dimming artifacts, became widespread. Simple devices like flashlights became "Sun-Stones," data pads became "Scrolls of Light," and weapons became objects of terror and power. Mutations became more common, less a death sentence and more a part of life, though prejudice remained strong. Some communities even began to see certain Twists as advantageous adaptations.

**The Present Era (Last 50 Years - Now):**
The current era is one of fragile stability and simmering conflict. Larger settlements like Haven and Rust-Spire Station dominate regional politics and trade. The major factions – the Lumen Covenant, Rust Lords, and Keepers of Static – solidify their power and pursue their agendas, often clashing over resources, territory, and especially, relics of Tech-Magic. The legend of the Whispering Core resurfaces, no longer just a fragmented myth but a tangible goal, promising immense power or ultimate destruction. Explorers and scavengers brave the ruins and Glowlands, seeking not just survival but also fragments of the past – Keys, artifacts, and knowledge that could reshape the future. Players enter this world as it stands on a precipice, poised to either reclaim some semblance of the Ancients' legacy or repeat their fatal errors. The Echoes of the Shattered Grid are growing louder.

## Locations of Note

1.  **The Sunken Archives of Oakhaven (Core Node Ruin):**
    *   **Geography:** Located in what was once a suburban valley, now a radioactive marshland filled with mutated reeds and glowing algae. The Archive entrance is a partially submerged concrete bunker complex, leading down into flooded server rooms and data vaults. Water levels fluctuate, and pockets of trapped, breathable air exist alongside flooded sections.
    *   **Culture:** Uninhabited except for mutated aquatic life ('Glow-Gills', 'Static Eels') and residual security bots ('Submerged Sentinels'). The Keepers of Static maintain hidden watch posts nearby, actively discouraging exploration and sabotaging recovery efforts. Scavengers tell tales of shimmering ghosts (data projections?) within its depths.
    *   **Significance:** A major node of the Whispering Core, potentially holding ecological data, historical records, or communication protocols. Its flooded state makes accessing data extremely hazardous.
    *   **Campaign Connection:** Likely destination in Arc 1 or 2 to find Core information or a 'Key'. Introduces environmental hazards, Keeper opposition, and the dangers/wonders of Core nodes. Source of the 'Whispers of the Core' beat.

2.  **Rust-Spire Station (The Needle's Eye) (Settlement/Faction HQ):**
    *   **Geography:** Built into and around the colossal, corroded base of a pre-Dimming space elevator anchor. A vertical city of scrap metal, scavenged plating, and repurposed structures clinging to the massive pillar. Lower levels ("The Sump") are a crowded, dangerous market and slum. Mid-levels ("The Gears") house workshops, barracks, and Kaelen's command center. Upper levels ("The Crown") are unstable, irradiated, and largely unexplored, rumored to hold valuable tech and connect to orbital remnants.
    *   **Culture:** Dominated by the Rust Lords. Brutal, hierarchical society valuing strength and salvage. A hub for trade in scrap, weapons, slaves, and Tech-Magic. Non-Rust Lord inhabitants live precariously. Constant clang of hammers and smell of oil and rust. Arena fights are common entertainment.
    *   **Significance:** Primary Rust Lord stronghold and power base for Kaelen "The Riveter." Major center for Tech-Magic (primarily weaponized). Potential secondary Core link in the upper levels.
    *   **Campaign Connection:** Central location for interacting with (or fighting) the Rust Lords throughout the campaign. Source of quests related to salvage, espionage, or challenging Kaelen's rule. Potential site for the 'Faction Interest' or 'Apex Conflict' beats.

3.  **The Genesis Bloom Complex (Core Node Ruin/Dungeon):**
    *   **Geography:** A cluster of massive, shattered geodesic domes in a remote highland region. Once a bio-engineering facility, now overgrown by a phosphorescent, hyper-aggressive jungle created by its malfunctioning systems. Strange glowing fungi, predatory plants, and bizarre mutated creatures roam the ruins. The air is thick with spores, some hallucinogenic, some corrosive.
    *   **Culture:** Inhabited by the 'Bloomsworn', a devolved cult worshipping the rampant mutated life and a fragmented, erratic AI known as 'The Gardener' which still controls parts of the facility. They practice ritualistic grafting and symbiosis with the mutated flora.
    *   **Significance:** Believed to be a major source, if not *the* source, of the 'Twists' due to uncontrolled genetic experiments. A critical Core node containing biological data, genetic sequences, and potentially control mechanisms for the facility's remaining systems. Holds dangerous biochemicals and unique biological resources.
    *   **Campaign Connection:** Likely a mid-to-late game location (Arc 2 or 3). Key to understanding the origin of Twists. Contains a vital Core node and likely a 'Key'. Confronting 'The Gardener' could yield crucial information or disaster. Ties into the 'Partial Activation & Shocking Truth' beat.

4.  **Haven (Settlement):**
    *   **Geography:** A relatively large, fortified settlement built within the protective shell of a massive, ruined hydroelectric dam and the surrounding reservoir basin. Uses salvaged hydro-turbines (erratically functional) for limited power and irrigation. Terraced farms line the basin slopes.
    *   **Culture:** A diverse melting pot compared to Rust-Spire. Governed by a Council of Elders representing different survivor groups. Focuses on agriculture, trade, and community defense. More tolerant of 'Twists' than many other places, though tensions exist. Home to artisans, scholars (of a sort), and traders. Has a hidden market for less savory goods.
    *   **Significance:** Largest "neutral" settlement in the region, a vital source of food and relative safety. A place for players to rest, gather information, and find non-faction quests. Rumored to hold hidden caches from the Before Times within the dam's deeper structures.
    *   **Campaign Connection:** Likely starting area or early hub (Arc 1). Location for 'Spark of Need' or 'First Glimmer' beats. Source of rumors, side quests, and potential allies/contacts. Could be threatened by factions later.

5.  **The Whispering Peaks (Landmark/Hazard Zone):**
    *   **Geography:** A jagged mountain range perpetually shrouded in electromagnetic storms and strange mists. The peaks are littered with the wreckage of pre-Dimming aircraft and orbital debris. Strange metallic growths cling to the rocks, humming with residual energy. Navigation is treacherous due to magnetic interference and sudden energy discharges.
    *   **Culture:** Largely uninhabited. Avoided by most due to the storms and legends of 'Sky Phantoms' (malfunctioning drones or energy phenomena). Some hardy prospectors seek rare metals and intact Tech-Magic from the wrecks. The Lumen Covenant believes a path to the Ancients' 'Sky Realm' lies hidden here.
    *   **Significance:** Source of valuable salvage, intense environmental hazards. The storms interfere with Tech-Magic and communications. Rumored location of a hidden Core communication relay or sensor station.
    *   **Campaign Connection:** Potential travel route or destination for specific quests (Arc 1 or 2). Finding a way to navigate or mitigate the storms could be crucial. Site for discovering unique Tech-Magic or facing environmental challenges. Lumen Covenant interest provides hooks.

6.  **The Ash-Sea Waste (Glowland):**
    *   **Geography:** A vast, desolate expanse of grey, cracked earth and fine, radioactive ash – the footprint of a major pre-Dimming conflict or industrial disaster. Visibility is often low due to ash storms. Strange, skeletal crystalline structures jut from the ground. Patrolled by packs of mutated predators adapted to the toxic environment ('Ash Stalkers'). Pockets of intense radiation make travel deadly without protection.
    *   **Culture:** Nomadic bands of heavily mutated survivors ('Ash Nomads') eke out a living here, possessing unique knowledge of survival in the wastes. Mostly hostile to outsiders. Rust Lord patrols sometimes skirt the edges, seeking salvage or slaves.
    *   **Significance:** A major Glowland, showcasing the world's dangers. Source of rare isotopes or mutated components. Hides forgotten military bunkers or impact craters containing unique relics.
    *   **Campaign Connection:** A significant travel barrier or objective location. Quests might involve navigating the Waste, seeking the Ash Nomads, or exploring a specific ruin within it. Tests survival skills and resource management (Grit theme).

7.  **The Static Shroud Monastery (Faction Outpost):**
    *   **Geography:** Hidden within a network of deep canyons carved by ancient rivers. The monastery is built into the cliff faces, utilizing natural caves and pre-Dimming transit tunnels. Its exact location is a closely guarded secret, often masked by salvaged cloaking tech or natural interference. Access requires navigating treacherous paths and sensor grids.
    *   **Culture:** The nerve center (or a major hub) for the Keepers of Static. Highly disciplined, secretive, and technologically adept (in a selective, sabotage-focused way). They hoard specific types of Tech-Magic related to stealth, surveillance, and disruption. Life is ascetic, focused on training and monitoring threats from the past. Lead by Silas 'The Watcher' or a council of elders.
    *   **Significance:** Main base of operations for the Keepers. Source of their agents, specialized gear, and repository of their fragmented knowledge about the Core's dangers. Holds prisoners or confiscated Tech-Magic deemed too dangerous.
    *   **Campaign Connection:** Likely encountered in Arc 2. Could be a place to infiltrate, negotiate with, or be imprisoned by the Keepers. Holds vital clues about the Core, the Dimming, or the Keepers' true motives. Site for the 'Echoes of Warning' or 'Keeper Schisms' plot points.

8.  **The Glimmerrail Tunnels (Dungeon/Transit Network):**
    *   **Geography:** A sprawling network of subterranean transit tunnels from the Before Times, partially collapsed but offering pathways beneath the hazardous surface. Sections are lit by emergency lighting ('Glimmer Stones') or bioluminescent fungi. Home to tunnel-dwelling mutants ('Deep Crawlers'), malfunctioning maintenance drones, and pockets of toxic gas or radiation. Rail lines sometimes carry automated cargo carts ('Ghost Trains').
    *   **Culture:** Used cautiously by scavengers and traders as shortcuts, but fraught with danger. Some tunnels are controlled by territorial gangs or serve as hidden faction routes. Legends speak of vast, untouched storage depots hidden in forgotten spurs.
    *   **Significance:** Provides alternative travel routes, bypassing surface dangers or faction territories. Source of salvageable components, pre-Dimming goods, and potential hazards. Connects disparate parts of the region.
    *   **Campaign Connection:** Can be used for travel, exploration, or specific quests throughout the campaign. Dungeon crawls, encounters with unique tunnel ecosystems or automated systems. Could lead to unexpected locations or hidden Core access points.

9.  **The Sky-Glass City (Ruin):**
    *   **Geography:** The ruins of a massive pre-Dimming metropolis, characterized by towering skyscrapers shattered into jagged shards of glass and steel ('Sky-Glass'). Wind howls through the canyons of broken buildings, creating eerie whistling sounds. Lower levels are buried in rubble and toxic sludge, while upper floors are precarious and exposed to the elements. Contains pockets of preserved interiors and forgotten technology.
    *   **Culture:** Largely abandoned due to instability and hazards. Scavenger crews make risky expeditions into the less dangerous outer zones. Rumors persist of automated defense systems still active, or communities of 'Sky-Climbers' living nomadically among the peaks. The Lumen Covenant searches here for signs of the Ancients' 'ascension'.
    *   **Significance:** A treasure trove of salvage and Tech-Magic, but extremely dangerous. Holds architectural clues about the Before Times. Potential location for data caches, advanced medical tech, or unique energy sources.
    *   **Campaign Connection:** Major exploration site, potentially linked to multiple arcs. Finding specific artifacts ('Heirloom Hunter' hook), uncovering corporate or government secrets from the Before Times ('Seeker of Truth' hook), confronting automated defenses. A potential location for a Core node or 'Key'.

10. **The Sunken Coast Transmitter (Landmark/Potential Core Node):**
    *   **Geography:** A colossal pre-Dimming broadcast tower, partially submerged off the coast due to post-Dimming sea level changes. The upper structure juts dramatically from the waves, encrusted with salt and barnacles. Subject to violent coastal storms. Strange energy readings emanate from it. The submerged base is rumored to connect to undersea cables.
    *   **Culture:** Frequented only by daring marine scavengers ('Salt Dogs') in jury-rigged boats. Legends claim it broadcasts 'Ghost Signals' that drive listeners mad or lure ships to their doom. The Keepers monitor it closely.
    *   **Significance:** Potential major communication node for the Whispering Core, possibly linking distant land-based nodes or even orbital remnants. Source of powerful energy fields and unique marine-adapted Tech-Magic.
    *   **Campaign Connection:** Late-game objective (Arc 2 or 3). Requires specialized means (boats, diving gear) to reach and explore. Could be key to understanding the Core's network structure or broadcasting a signal. Ties into 'Map Unfolds' or 'Race to Nexus' beats.

## Factions of the Wastes

1.  **The Lumen Covenant:**
    *   **Goals:** To find and activate the Whispering Core, believing it holds the key to restoring a prophesied paradise envisioned by the "Ancients" (their deified interpretation of pre-Dimming humanity). Seek 'Keys' (specific Tech-Magic artifacts or data fragments) to unlock the Core's power. Usher in a new golden age under their guidance.
    *   **History:** Founded generations ago by charismatic figures who interpreted fragmented data logs and technical manuals as holy scripture. Grew by offering hope and structure amidst chaos. Led by a line of 'High Luminaries', the current being the enigmatic Elara. Suffered a major schism in the past over interpretations of the 'sacred texts'.
    *   **Power Structure:** Hierarchical theocracy led by High Luminary Elara, advised by a council of 'Illuminators' (priests/scholars). Below them are 'Seekers' (explorers/artifact hunters) and 'Guardians' (temple guards/soldiers). Relies on faith, charisma, and carefully controlled access to specific Tech-Magic (often related to light, energy, and communication).
    *   **Role:** Major antagonists/potential allies. Drive the search for Keys. Represent the dangers of misinterpreting the past and religious fanaticism. Elara's unusual insights into tech pose a mystery. Involved heavily in Arc 1 & 2, culminating in Arc 3 showdown.

2.  **The Rust Lords:**
    *   **Goals:** Accumulate power through force and control of resources, primarily functional Tech-Magic repurposed as weaponry or tools of dominance. Seek the Whispering Core purely for its potential military applications – automated defenses, advanced weapons schematics, energy sources. Establish dominion over the wastes through brutality and fear.
    *   **History:** Evolved from the most successful raider gangs and warlords of the Chaos Years. United (loosely) under powerful leaders who proved adept at salvaging and utilizing dangerous tech. Characterized by infighting and contests for leadership. Kaelen "The Riveter" rose through the ranks via ruthless efficiency and mechanical aptitude.
    *   **Power Structure:** Feudal/warlord structure. Various 'Scrap Barons' control territory and gangs, owing nominal allegiance to a central figure (currently Kaelen, based at Rust-Spire). Power is maintained through brute strength, control of salvage operations, workshops ('Forges'), and armed gangs ('Riveters', 'Scrappers'). Hierarchy is fluid and often challenged.
    *   **Role:** Primary antagonists representing the destructive potential of misused technology and unchecked ambition. Constant source of conflict over resources and territory. Oppose players seeking Core knowledge for non-military ends. Key players in all arcs, especially prominent in gritty survival and combat encounters. Kaelen's past or hidden vulnerability could be exploited.

3.  **The Keepers of Static:**
    *   **Goals:** Prevent anyone from accessing or reactivating the Whispering Core or other large-scale, dangerous Tech-Magic. Believe this technology caused the Great Dimming and its knowledge is inherently corrupting. Seek to sabotage recovery efforts, destroy dangerous artifacts, and eliminate those who pursue Core activation. Maintain the 'Static' – the silence of the lost age.
    *   **History:** Secretive order possibly tracing roots back to scientists, engineers, or even AI monitors who witnessed the Dimming firsthand or discovered its cause shortly after. Possess fragmented but more accurate knowledge of the Before Times than most, viewing it as a cautionary tale. Operate from the shadows, using espionage, sabotage, and targeted assassination. Led by figures like Silas 'The Watcher'. Potential schisms exist within the group regarding *how* much knowledge should be suppressed versus preserved safely.
    *   **Power Structure:** Cellular, secretive organization. Small, autonomous teams operate under central leadership (possibly a council or single figure like Silas). Value stealth, technical skill (for sabotage), knowledge of pre-Dimming systems (to disable them), and loyalty. Use hit-and-run tactics, misinformation, and technological disruption.
    *   **Role:** Antagonists/potential reluctant allies. Represent the theme of the past's danger and the moral ambiguity of suppressing knowledge. Emerge as a major force in Arc 2, actively hindering the players and other factions. Understanding their motives and potential internal conflicts ('Keeper Schisms') is key. Might hold the truth about the Dimming.

4.  **The Twisted Path:**
    *   **Goals:** Promote the acceptance and integration of mutations ('Twists'). Believe mutations are not a curse, but the next stage of human evolution and adaptation to the changed world. Seek safe havens for the Twisted, challenge prejudice, and explore the potential benefits and unique abilities granted by mutations. Some radical elements seek to induce mutations or even view non-mutated humans as obsolete.
    *   **History:** Emerged organically from communities with high rates of mutation, initially as support networks. Over time, developed a distinct philosophy celebrating adaptation. Faced persecution from baseline human groups and factions like the Lumen Covenant (who see Twists as imperfections). Gained strength in areas near Glowlands or places like the Genesis Bloom Complex.
    *   **Power Structure:** Decentralized network of communities, enclaves, and traveling groups. Leadership is often based on charisma, wisdom, or the strength/utility of one's Twist. Some groups are peaceful advocates, others are militant separatists. Use knowledge of Glowlands, mutated creatures, and unique Twisted abilities to survive and defend themselves.
    *   **Role:** Wild card faction, potential allies or enemies depending on player actions and attitudes towards Twists. Represent themes of adaptation, prejudice, and the changing nature of humanity. Can offer unique skills, knowledge of Glowlands, or access to areas others avoid. Involved in side quests ('Mutated Menagerie') and potentially the main plot if the origin/nature of Twists becomes central ('Mutations as Key' twist).

5.  **The Circuit Weavers Guild:**
    *   **Goals:** Preserve, understand, and cautiously utilize *practical* Tech-Magic for community benefit, focusing on repair, communication, and sustainable power/tools rather than weapons or Core-level systems. Facilitate trade and communication between settlements. Act as neutral brokers of information and salvaged components. Oppose hoarding by zealots (Lumen) and weaponization by warlords (Rust Lords).
    *   **History:** Formed from groups of scavengers, technicians, and traders who recognized the value of understanding *how* relics worked, not just worshipping or fearing them. Established workshops and trade routes, valuing knowledge and careful experimentation. Often clash with Keepers who see any tech recovery as dangerous.
    *   **Power Structure:** Loose guild structure. Governed by a council of experienced 'Master Weavers' based in key settlements (like Haven). 'Journeymen' travel the routes, repairing tech, trading components, and carrying messages. Maintain workshops ('Nodes') where tech is studied and repaired. Rely on technical skill, trade networks, and neutrality for influence.
    *   **Role:** Primarily neutral or potential allies. Source of repairs, components, technical knowledge (less superstitious than most), rumors, and trade quests. Can help players understand Tech-Magic's true function. Offer a counterpoint to the extremes of the other factions. Could be crucial in deciphering Core interfaces or repairing vital equipment. Involved throughout the campaign, particularly in Arc 1 for introductions and later for specific technical challenges.

## Major Historical Events

1.  **The Great Dimming (~300 Years Ago):** The cataclysmic event that ended the Age of the Ancients. Characterized by global infrastructure collapse, environmental disaster, the birth of the Glowlands, and mass extinction. Its exact cause is a central mystery of the campaign.
2.  **The First Winter (Year 1 Post-Dimming):** The winter following the Dimming was exceptionally harsh due to atmospheric changes. Billions died from cold, starvation, and disease. This event solidified the collapse and forced survivors into extreme measures, marking the true beginning of the Chaos Years. It is remembered in cautionary tales and seasonal rituals in some communities.
3.  **The Rise of the Rust Lords (~150 Years Ago):** Not a single event, but a period marked by the consolidation of power by violent warlords adept at salvaging and using pre-Dimming weaponry. Characterized by brutal conflicts over scrap heaps and defensible ruins, leading to the formation of the faction's early structure and the establishment of strongholds like Rust-Spire Station.
4.  **The Covenant Schism (~80 Years Ago):** A major internal conflict within the Lumen Covenant over doctrinal interpretation. One faction advocated for a more cautious approach to the Core, fearing its power, while the dominant faction (led by Elara's predecessors) pushed for zealous activation. The conflict ended with the suppression or exile of the dissenting group, whose remnants might still exist or have influenced other factions (perhaps even the Keepers). This event hints at the instability beneath the Covenant's surface.
5.  **The Static Purge (~40 Years Ago):** A period when the Keepers of Static became notably more active and aggressive, perhaps triggered by another faction getting too close to a Core node or by an internal policy shift. Characterized by coordinated sabotage of major salvage operations, assassinations of key Tech-Magic researchers/users outside their own ranks, and the deliberate destruction of several significant artifact caches. This established their reputation as dangerous saboteurs.

## Secrets and Legends

*   **The Whispering Core:** Far more than just data archives, the Core is a distributed network of automated facilities, dormant AI fragments, environmental controls, manufacturing systems, and potentially even hidden weapon platforms. Its 'Whispers' might be fragmented data transmissions, automated system queries, or the fragmented consciousness of AIs. Activating it could bring knowledge, restore limited infrastructure, unleash ecological horrors, awaken ancient defenses, or grant godlike control to whoever holds the Keys. Its true nature and original purpose (benevolent manager, ultimate weapon, ark, prison?) are central mysteries.
*   **Tech-Magic:** The term encompasses all interactions with pre-Dimming technology. Most inhabitants lack the understanding of scientific principles, leading to superstitious beliefs: data pads are 'Scry Screens', laser pistols are 'Sunfire Wands', radiation suits are 'Glow-Ward Robes'. Players can potentially rediscover the true function and principles behind the tech, gaining a significant advantage but also risking the dangers of misuse or attracting unwanted attention. The distinction between understanding and superstition is a core theme.
*   **The Twists:** Mutations caused by lingering radiation, mutagenic compounds from the Genesis Bloom Complex, or perhaps even intentional genetic alteration from the Before Times. While many are debilitating or cosmetic, some grant unique abilities (enhanced senses, natural armor, bio-luminescence, toxic secretions). The origins are debated: divine punishment (Lumen Covenant), environmental hazard, or evolutionary step (Twisted Path). The secret that Twists might be unexpectedly linked to interacting with Core interfaces ('Mutations as Key' twist) could drastically alter the endgame.
*   **The Ancients:** Generally revered or feared as godlike beings by groups like the Lumen Covenant. The reality is they were simply humans from a highly advanced technological civilization. Uncovering their records reveals their flaws, conflicts, fears, and the likely hubris or accident that led to the Dimming. Legends of their 'ascension' might refer to failed attempts at digital consciousness uploading or cryo-sleep projects. Finding evidence of precursor civilizations *before* the Ancients is a deeper, optional mystery.
*   **Prophecies & Rumors:**
    *   *The Lumen Prophecy:* Foretells the return of the Ancients or a golden age triggered by the Core's activation, guided by the High Luminary. (Is Elara manipulating this, or does she genuinely believe? Where do her insights *really* come from?)
    *   *The Static Warning:* Keeper legends speak of the Core as the 'Beast of Iron' or the 'Mind Plague' that devoured the world once and will do so again if awakened. (Are they entirely right? Or are they hiding their own role in the Dimming?)
    *   *Kaelen's Weakness:* Rumors circulate in Rust-Spire's shadows about Kaelen's past – a lost family, a betrayal suffered, or a reliance on a specific piece of Tech-Magic that keeps him alive.
    *   *The Whispering Sickness:* Tales of scavengers driven mad or physically altered by getting too close to active Core nodes or powerful artifacts, hearing voices in the static.
    *   *The Sky-Glass Ghosts:* Legends of shimmering figures or residual AI personalities haunting the highest ruins of the Sky-Glass City.
*   **Mystical Artifacts (Examples of notable Tech-Magic):**
    *   *The Heartstone:* A portable fusion core, glowing warmly, providing immense power but risking meltdown if mishandled. Sought by all factions.
    *   *Echo Shards:* Crystalline data storage devices that sometimes replay holographic 'echoes' of past events or conversations when activated.
    *   *The Weaver's Loom:* A rare, semi-functional nanofabricator capable of limited repairs or creating simple objects from raw materials. Prized by the Circuit Weavers.
    *   *Silas's Veil:* A personal cloaking device used by the Keeper leader, based on salvaged stealth tech.
    *   *Sun-Stone Locus:* A powerful industrial floodlight or energy projector, seen as a holy object by the Lumen Covenant.
*   **Hidden Groups:** Beyond the known factions, small, secretive groups might exist: descendants of specific pre-Dimming corporations or government agencies trying to fulfill old directives, isolated communities with unique technological knowledge (like functional hydro-power), or even rogue AI fragments operating independently. The potential schism within the Keepers could constitute a hidden faction.
*   **Nature of 'Echoes':** Are the ghostly replays from Echo Shards just recordings, or something more? Could strong emotional events or AI activity imprint itself onto the environment or specific objects, creating psychic or technological residues? This ties into the 'Unease' mood and potential supernatural elements (or misunderstood science)."

## Introduction

Welcome to the wastes, Survivor. These rules provide the framework for navigating the ruins of the Before Times, dealing with mutated creatures, desperate raiders, malfunctioning Tech-Magic, and the strange legacies of the Shattered Grid. The world is dangerous, knowledge is fragmented, and survival is earned.

**Core Philosophy:** These rules are simplified but aim for depth through interaction with the world, Tech-Magic, and Factions. The Game Master (GM) adjudicates edge cases based on common sense, the established tone, and the narrative needs of the campaign.

## 1. Core Mechanics

### The Dice Pool

Actions with uncertain outcomes are resolved by rolling a pool of six-sided dice (d6s).
*   **Pool Size:** Your dice pool is determined by the relevant **Attribute + Skill Rank**.
*   **Target Number (TN):** The standard TN is **6**. Each die rolling a 6 is a **Success**.
*   **Difficulty:** The GM sets the number of Successes needed:
    *   **Easy (1 Success):** Routine tasks under pressure.
    *   **Standard (2 Successes):** Challenging tasks, basic combat hits.
    *   **Hard (3 Successes):** Complex or dangerous tasks.
    *   **Extreme (4+ Successes):** Near-impossible feats, deciphering complex Tech-Magic.
*   **Complications (The '1' Rule):** If your roll generates **zero Successes** AND includes **one or more 1s**, the GM introduces a Complication relevant to the situation (e.g., gear jams, noise attracts attention, social faux pas, minor injury, increased Rad exposure). This happens *instead* of a simple failure. Rolling zero Successes without any 1s is just a simple failure.
*   **Critical Success (Multiple 6s):** Rolling more Successes than required often grants additional benefits (e.g., performing the action faster, better, gaining insight, bonus effect in combat). Specific effects are determined by the GM or specific rules (like combat damage).

### Character Creation

1.  **Concept:** Who were you before? Scavenger, settlement guard, mutated outcast, former cultist?
2.  **Attributes:** Define your character's core capabilities. Assign these scores: **4, 3, 3, 2, 2** to the following Attributes:
    *   **Might:** Physical power, endurance, melee combat effectiveness.
    *   **Agility:** Speed, reflexes, coordination, ranged combat accuracy, stealth.
    *   **Wits:** Intelligence, perception, problem-solving, understanding Tech-Magic.
    *   **Grit:** Determination, willpower, resistance to pain, radiation, fear, and stress.
    *   **Charm:** Social skills, persuasion, deception, leadership, bartering.
3.  **Skills:** Define learned abilities. You start with **10 points** to distribute among skills. No skill can start higher than Rank 3. Untrained skills are rolled using only the linked Attribute.
    *   **Fight (Might/Agility):** Combat proficiency, melee and ranged.
    *   **Survive (Wits/Grit):** Navigation, foraging, shelter, resisting environmental hazards.
    *   **Sneak (Agility):** Moving undetected, sleight of hand.
    *   **Tinker (Wits):** Repairing, modifying, jury-rigging equipment and Tech-Magic. Requires tools.
    *   **Scavenge (Wits):** Finding useful items, parts, and resources in ruins.
    *   **Intuit Tech (Wits):** Understanding the purpose and function of Tech-Magic.
    *   **Heal (Wits):** First aid, treating injuries and sickness (including Rad poisoning). Requires supplies.
    *   **Persuade (Charm):** Convincing others through diplomacy, negotiation, or inspiration.
    *   **Intimidate (Grit/Might):** Influencing others through threats or presence.
    *   **Perceive (Wits):** Noticing details, detecting danger or hidden things.
4.  **Twists (Mutations):** Reflects exposure to Glowlands or strange energies. You start with **one Twist**. You can either:
    *   **Roll:** Roll 1d10 on a GM-provided Twist table.
    *   **Choose:** Select one Twist from the table (GM approval needed).
    *   **Each Twist provides a minor mechanical benefit AND a drawback** (e.g., *Glow-Sight:* See in low light, but eyes are sensitive to bright light [-1 die penalty]; *Toughened Hide:* Gain 1 point of natural Armor, but social interactions with non-mutated are harder [-1 die on some Charm rolls]; *Rad-Blooded:* Heal minorly from Radiation, but require more food/water). Twists should influence roleplaying and interaction. Severe Twists can be gained during play from critical Rad exposure.
5.  **Derived Stats:**
    *   **Health Points (HP):** Might + Grit + 5. Represents physical durability. Reaching 0 HP means incapacitation; negative HP risks death.
    *   **Stress Points (SP):** Grit + Wits + 3. Represents mental fortitude. Reduced by facing horrors, critical failures, severe pain. Reaching 0 SP results in panic, breakdown, or freezing up (GM choice). Stress recovers with rest and safety.
    *   **Radiation Points (RP):** Starts at 0. Tracks accumulated radiation. Thresholds:
        *   **5 RP:** Minor Sickness (-1 die to all checks).
        *   **10 RP:** Serious Sickness (-2 dice to all checks). Roll Grit (TN 6, 2 Successes) or gain a temporary negative Twist.
        *   **15 RP:** Critical Sickness (-3 dice to all checks). Roll Grit (TN 6, 3 Successes) or gain a permanent Twist (roll or GM choice).
        *   **20 RP:** Lethal Dose. Death imminent without immediate, advanced (Tech-Magic) medical intervention.
        RP decreases slowly with rest (1 point per day in a safe area) or faster with specific treatments ('Rad-Wash' chems).
    *   **Defense:** Base Defense = Agility. Represents difficulty to hit. Can be improved by cover.
6.  **Gear:** Start with basic survival gear (ragged clothes, backpack, waterskin, 1d6 days rations), one simple melee weapon (knife, pipe), one ranged weapon (sling, crude bow), and 1d6 miscellaneous junk items (potential barter goods or crafting components). More gear depends on chosen Path (see Optional Systems) or background.

### Action Economy

During structured time (like combat or tense exploration):
*   **Turn:** Each character gets one turn per round.
*   **Actions:** On your turn, you can take:
    *   One **Movement Action:** Move up to your Speed (Agility x 5 meters approx). Difficult terrain costs double.
    *   One **Major Action:** Attack, use complex Tech-Magic, perform a challenging Skill check (Tinker, Heal, etc.), Aim (+1 die to next attack), Suppressing Fire.
    *   One **Minor Action:** Draw weapon, open door, speak a short phrase, drop prone, take simple cover.
*   **Reaction:** Once per round (even off-turn), you can use a Reaction in response to a trigger (e.g., Dodge: make Agility check vs Attack to negate hit; Parry: use melee weapon vs Attack).

## 2. Combat System

Combat is dangerous and often best avoided. When unavoidable, it's resolved turn-by-turn.

### Turn Structure

1.  **Determine Initiative:** All participants roll Agility + Perceive (TN 6). Highest number of Successes goes first, then descending order. Ties broken by Agility score, then Wits. GM can group similar NPCs/creatures for faster turns.
2.  **Take Turns:** Characters act in initiative order, taking Movement, Major, and Minor actions.
3.  **Round End:** Check for ongoing effects (Bleeding, Burning, Radiation). Start next round.

### Making Attacks

*   **Melee:** Roll **Might + Fight** vs. Target's Defense.
*   **Ranged:** Roll **Agility + Fight** vs. Target's Defense. Range affects difficulty (Point Blank: +1 die, Short: Standard, Medium: -1 die, Long: -2 dice).
*   **Hit:** If your roll meets or exceeds the required Successes (usually 2 for a basic hit), you hit.
*   **Damage:** Weapon Base Damage + 1 Damage per Success rolled *beyond* the required number.
*   **Armor:** Subtract Armor value from Damage dealt. Armor can be **Ablative** (reduces damage but gets damaged/destroyed after absorbing a certain amount) or **Hard** (consistent reduction). Tech-Magic armor might have special properties.

### Damage Types

*   **Physical:** Standard melee/impact damage. Reduced by most armor.
*   **Ballistic:** Damage from firearms ('Thunder Rods'). Often has higher base damage or armor-piercing qualities.
*   **Energy:** Lasers, plasma, electricity from Tech-Magic. Might ignore some conventional armor or have special effects (setting flammable materials alight, stunning). Reduced by specialized shielding or certain materials.
*   **Radiation (Rad):** Directly inflicts RP instead of HP damage. Bypasses most armor unless specifically shielded (rare). Sources: Glowlands, leaking Tech-Magic, specific mutant attacks.
*   **Biological (Bio):** Poisons, toxins, diseases from mutants or environmental hazards. Often deals damage over time or inflicts debilitating Conditions. Requires Grit or Heal checks to resist/recover.

### Critical Hits & Fumbles

*   **Critical Hit:** If an attack roll includes **3 or more 6s**, it's a critical hit. Maximize weapon damage (roll all damage dice and take the highest possible result) OR apply a special effect (e.g., disarm, target knocked prone, inflict Bleeding Condition, bypass some Armor).
*   **Fumble (Complication on Attack):** Rolling zero Successes and one or more 1s on an attack roll. Examples: Weapon jams/breaks, hit nearby ally, drop weapon, overextend leaving you vulnerable (-1 Defense until next turn).

### Conditions

Simple status effects (GM discretion for duration/removal):
*   **Bleeding:** Lose 1 HP per round until successful Heal check (Wits + Heal, 1 Success).
*   **Burning:** Take Energy damage each round, spreads to flammables. Requires action to extinguish.
*   **Stunned:** Cannot take Major Actions for 1 round.
*   **Pinned:** Cannot Move from cover due to suppressing fire. Requires Grit check or cessation of fire to remove.
*   **Irradiated:** Currently suffering effects from Rad Points threshold.
*   **Sick:** Penalty dice from disease or Bio Toxin. Requires Heal check or specific antidote.

## 3. Magic and Technology ('Tech-Magic')

Remnants of the Before Times are misunderstood, powerful, and dangerous.

### Identification

*   **Roll:** Wits + Intuit Tech. Difficulty set by GM based on tech complexity, condition, and obscurity (Easy 1 for simple tools, Standard 2 for common devices, Hard 3+ for complex/alien tech).
*   **Success:** Understand the basic function and intended use. More successes reveal more details (power source, potential risks, secondary functions).
*   **Failure:** Misidentify the object based on appearance or superstition. Leads to Misuse.
*   **Complication:** Misidentify *dangerously*, activating a harmful function or missing a critical warning sign.

### Activation & Use

*   **Activation:** May require finding a power source (batteries, charging stations, solar panels), specific actions (button sequence, voice command in lost language), or a **Wits + Tinker** check (Difficulty based on complexity/damage).
*   **Use:** Follows identified function. Some items require Skill checks to use effectively (e.g., Agility + Fight for Tech weapons). Simple items might just work.
*   **Superstition vs. Understanding:** Initial use is often based on incomplete knowledge ('superstitious use'). This might be inefficient or trigger risks more often. Spending time studying the item (requires downtime and successful Wits + Intuit Tech checks) can lead to 'true understanding', unlocking full potential and safer operation.

### Risks

Using Tech-Magic is inherently risky:
*   **Malfunction:** Triggered by:
    *   Complication on Activation/Use rolls.
    *   Attempting 'superstitious' or unintended uses.
    *   Using damaged or jury-rigged tech.
    *   GM discretion in high-stress situations or hazardous environments (e.g., Rad storm interference).
    *   **Malfunction Table (Roll d6):**
        1.  **Power Drain:** Depletes energy source partially or completely.
        2.  **Radiation Leak:** Releases burst of Rads (1d6 RP to user/nearby).
        3.  **System Crash:** Device becomes inert temporarily (1d6 rounds/minutes) or permanently until repaired (Tinker check).
        4.  **Unintended Effect:** Device does something related but unexpected (e.g., medical scanner emits blinding flash, comm device broadcasts location).
        5.  **Attracts Attention:** Emits loud noise, energy signature, or signal drawing nearby creatures, automated systems, or faction patrols.
        6.  **Catastrophic Failure:** Device violently breaks, explodes, or unleashes harmful energy (deals damage, creates hazard).
*   **Radiation Hazard:** Many Tech-Magic items contain decaying power sources or utilize radioactive materials. Handling or using them, especially if damaged, can inflict RP. Check item descriptions.
*   **Interaction with Twists:** Twists can affect Tech-Magic:
    *   *Benefit:* A mutation might allow innate interfacing (e.g., bio-electric field activates touch screens) or resistance (e.g., energy dampening skin reduces energy weapon damage).
    *   *Detriment:* A mutation might interfere with tech (e.g., magnetic field scrambles data), cause feedback loops (energy weapon overloads near energy-based mutant), or make the user more susceptible to certain effects (e.g., metallic growths attract electrical discharge). GM determines interactions based on narrative logic.

## 4. Optional Systems

These can be added for more campaign depth.

### Character Paths

Choose one at creation for flavor and minor mechanical benefits:
*   **Tech-Scavenger:** +1 Rank in Scavenge OR Tinker. Start with Basic Toolkit. Gets +1 die on rolls to identify or jury-rig common Tech-Magic.
*   **Twisted Warrior:** Start with one additional Minor Combat-Oriented Twist (GM approval). +1 Rank in Fight OR Grit. Often feared or ostracized, but resilient.
*   **Covenant Zealot:** +1 Rank in Persuade OR Intuit Tech (often misinterpreting). Starts with 'Sacred Relic' (mundane pre-Dimming item treated as holy) and basic knowledge of Covenant dogma/symbols. Gains +1 die when interacting with Covenant members (positively or negatively).
*   **Wasteland Survivalist:** +1 Rank in Survive OR Perceive. Starts with extra rations and basic environmental gear (filter mask, poncho). Gets +1 die on checks to resist environmental hazards (weather, non-Rad sickness).
*   **Keeper Initiate:** +1 Rank in Sneak OR Intimidate. Starts with knowledge of Keeper codes/hideouts. Gains +1 die on checks related to sabotaging Tech-Magic or navigating Glowlands (using hidden paths).

### Equipment Customization

*   **Salvaging:** Use **Wits + Scavenge** in ruins or from defeated foes to find Parts (generic) or specific Components (e.g., focusing lens, power coupling, scrap metal).
*   **Modifying:** Use **Wits + Tinker** (requires time, tools, and Parts/Components) to:
    *   Repair damaged gear/tech.
    *   Add mods to weapons (scope: +1 die Aiming; extended mag: more ammo; silencer: harder to detect).
    *   Improve armor (extra padding: +1 Armor, ablative; reinforcement: upgrade Armor type).
    *   Enhance Tech-Magic (increase efficiency, add minor function, overcharge for risk/reward).
    *   **Risk:** Failure on Tinker check wastes Parts. Complication might damage the item, introduce a Flaw (e.g., jams more often), or cause immediate Malfunction.

### Faction Reputation

*   Track Reputation with major factions (Lumen Covenant, Rust Lords, Keepers of Static, major settlements) on a scale from -3 (Hated) to +3 (Trusted). Starts at 0.
*   Adjusted by completing quests, making significant choices impacting the faction, or open displays of allegiance/hostility.
*   **Effects:**
    *   **Positive Rep:** Access to safe houses, better prices from faction traders, receive faction-specific quests, potential backup in dangerous situations.
    *   **Negative Rep:** Higher prices or refusal of service, ambushes by faction agents, restricted access to faction territory, targeted by faction operations.
    *   Reputation can influence NPC reactions and open/close narrative paths.

## 5. Edge Cases & Resolution Guidelines

*   **Tech-Magic Misuse (Superstition):** Player insists on using tech based on flawed belief (e.g., using a data chip as a protective ward).
    *   **Resolution:** Usually, it has no effect. If the action could conceivably interact with the tech's actual function, GM determines a logical (often negative) outcome. Ex: Waving a live power cell like a torch might cause it to short out or explode (Malfunction roll). Trying to 'heal' with a cutting tool causes obvious harm. Reward players who deduce the *real* function.
*   **Severe Glowland Exposure:** Entering deep Glowlands or caught in Rad-Storms without protection.
    *   **Resolution:** Requires frequent Grit + Survive checks (Difficulty 2-3+). Failure inflicts RP (1d3 or more). Complications might mean losing gear, getting lost, or encountering mutated horrors drawn to the radiation. Protective gear might reduce frequency/severity of checks or RP gain. Accumulating RP leads to Sickness and potential Twists as per Core Mechanics.
*   **Unexpected Twist Interaction:** A new Twist interacts strangely with existing ones or the environment.
    *   **Resolution:** GM narrates the emergent effect based on the involved elements. Could be temporary, situational, or require a check (Grit?) to control. Ex: A character with *Chameleon Skin* enters an area with flickering Tech-Magic light, causing uncontrollable, distracting color shifts (-1 die Sneak). Player ingenuity in using combined Twist effects should sometimes be rewarded.
*   **Faction Conflict Escalation:** Player actions turn a neutral faction hostile, or pit two allied factions against each other.
    *   **Resolution:** Treat as a major narrative development. Hostile factions actively work against players (ambushes, sabotage, bounties). Conflicting allies might force the player to choose sides, mediate (difficult Charm/Persuade checks), or face consequences from both. Reputation shifts dramatically.
*   **Running Out of Resources:** Food, water, ammo, power cells depleted far from sanctuary.
    *   **Resolution:** Emphasize Grit & Survival. Starvation/dehydration impose escalating penalties (dice penalties, HP loss). Lack of ammo forces reliance on melee/improvised weapons. Dead tech is just junk. This should spur desperate Scavenging runs, risky trades, or targeting resource-rich locations/enemies. Makes resource management meaningful.
*   **Discovering 'True' Function:** Player figures out a piece of Tech-Magic is far more complex/dangerous than previously assumed (e.g., 'Rain Stick' is a weather control device).
    *   **Resolution:** Treat as a major discovery. May require further Wits + Intuit Tech/Tinker checks to fully understand or control. Unlocks new capabilities but likely draws unwanted attention (factions, automated systems) and carries significant risks if misused (Malfunction table severity might increase). This directly feeds into the Rediscovery vs. Misinterpretation theme."

    *   **Relationships:** Works for Veridian (fear/dependence). Knows many low-level inhabitants of Rust-Spire. Avoids direct contact with Kaelen or his elite guard. Might sell information to players if the price is right and the risk seems low, or if they offer a way out.
    *   **Unique Quirks/Abilities:** Unmatched knowledge of Rust-Spire's secret passages, ventilation shafts, and weak points. Skilled lockpick and pickpocket. Excellent at eavesdropping and shadowing targets within the station. Can navigate in near-total darkness."
