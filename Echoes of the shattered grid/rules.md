# Echoes of the Shattered Grid - Core Ruleset v1.0

## Introduction

Welcome to the wastes, Survivor. These rules provide the framework for navigating the ruins of the Before Times, dealing with mutated creatures, desperate raiders, malfunctioning Tech-Magic, and the strange legacies of the Shattered Grid. The world is dangerous, knowledge is fragmented, and survival is earned.

**Core Philosophy:** These rules are simplified but aim for depth through interaction with the world, Tech-Magic, and Factions. The Game Master (GM) adjudicates edge cases based on common sense, the established tone, and the narrative needs of the campaign.

## 1. Core Mechanics

### The Dice Pool

Actions with uncertain outcomes are resolved by rolling a pool of six-sided dice (d6s).
*   **Pool Size:** Your dice pool is determined by the relevant **Attribute + Skill Rank**.
*   **Target Number (TN):** The standard TN is **6**. Each die rolling a 6 is a **Success**.
*   **Difficulty:** The GM sets the number of Successes needed:
    *   **Easy (1 Success):** Routine tasks under pressure.
    *   **Standard (2 Successes):** Challenging tasks, basic combat hits.
    *   **Hard (3 Successes):** Complex or dangerous tasks.
    *   **Extreme (4+ Successes):** Near-impossible feats, deciphering complex Tech-Magic.
*   **Complications (The '1' Rule):** If your roll generates **zero Successes** AND includes **one or more 1s**, the GM introduces a Complication relevant to the situation (e.g., gear jams, noise attracts attention, social faux pas, minor injury, increased Rad exposure). This happens *instead* of a simple failure. Rolling zero Successes without any 1s is just a simple failure.
*   **Critical Success (Multiple 6s):** Rolling more Successes than required often grants additional benefits (e.g., performing the action faster, better, gaining insight, bonus effect in combat). Specific effects are determined by the GM or specific rules (like combat damage).

### Character Creation

1.  **Concept:** Who were you before? Scavenger, settlement guard, mutated outcast, former cultist?
2.  **Attributes:** Define your character's core capabilities. Assign these scores: **4, 3, 3, 2, 2** to the following Attributes:
    *   **Might:** Physical power, endurance, melee combat effectiveness.
    *   **Agility:** Speed, reflexes, coordination, ranged combat accuracy, stealth.
    *   **Wits:** Intelligence, perception, problem-solving, understanding Tech-Magic.
    *   **Grit:** Determination, willpower, resistance to pain, radiation, fear, and stress.
    *   **Charm:** Social skills, persuasion, deception, leadership, bartering.
3.  **Skills:** Define learned abilities. You start with **10 points** to distribute among skills. No skill can start higher than Rank 3. Untrained skills are rolled using only the linked Attribute.
    *   **Fight (Might/Agility):** Combat proficiency, melee and ranged.
    *   **Survive (Wits/Grit):** Navigation, foraging, shelter, resisting environmental hazards.
    *   **Sneak (Agility):** Moving undetected, sleight of hand.
    *   **Tinker (Wits):** Repairing, modifying, jury-rigging equipment and Tech-Magic. Requires tools.
    *   **Scavenge (Wits):** Finding useful items, parts, and resources in ruins.
    *   **Intuit Tech (Wits):** Understanding the purpose and function of Tech-Magic.
    *   **Heal (Wits):** First aid, treating injuries and sickness (including Rad poisoning). Requires supplies.
    *   **Persuade (Charm):** Convincing others through diplomacy, negotiation, or inspiration.
    *   **Intimidate (Grit/Might):** Influencing others through threats or presence.
    *   **Perceive (Wits):** Noticing details, detecting danger or hidden things.
4.  **Twists (Mutations):** Reflects exposure to Glowlands or strange energies. You start with **one Twist**. You can either:
    *   **Roll:** Roll 1d10 on a GM-provided Twist table.
    *   **Choose:** Select one Twist from the table (GM approval needed).
    *   **Each Twist provides a minor mechanical benefit AND a drawback** (e.g., *Glow-Sight:* See in low light, but eyes are sensitive to bright light [-1 die penalty]; *Toughened Hide:* Gain 1 point of natural Armor, but social interactions with non-mutated are harder [-1 die on some Charm rolls]; *Rad-Blooded:* Heal minorly from Radiation, but require more food/water). Twists should influence roleplaying and interaction. Severe Twists can be gained during play from critical Rad exposure.
5.  **Derived Stats:**
    *   **Health Points (HP):** Might + Grit + 5. Represents physical durability. Reaching 0 HP means incapacitation; negative HP risks death.
    *   **Stress Points (SP):** Grit + Wits + 3. Represents mental fortitude. Reduced by facing horrors, critical failures, severe pain. Reaching 0 SP results in panic, breakdown, or freezing up (GM choice). Stress recovers with rest and safety.
    *   **Radiation Points (RP):** Starts at 0. Tracks accumulated radiation. Thresholds:
        *   **5 RP:** Minor Sickness (-1 die to all checks).
        *   **10 RP:** Serious Sickness (-2 dice to all checks). Roll Grit (TN 6, 2 Successes) or gain a temporary negative Twist.
        *   **15 RP:** Critical Sickness (-3 dice to all checks). Roll Grit (TN 6, 3 Successes) or gain a permanent Twist (roll or GM choice).
        *   **20 RP:** Lethal Dose. Death imminent without immediate, advanced (Tech-Magic) medical intervention.
        RP decreases slowly with rest (1 point per day in a safe area) or faster with specific treatments ('Rad-Wash' chems).
    *   **Defense:** Base Defense = Agility. Represents difficulty to hit. Can be improved by cover.
6.  **Gear:** Start with basic survival gear (ragged clothes, backpack, waterskin, 1d6 days rations), one simple melee weapon (knife, pipe), one ranged weapon (sling, crude bow), and 1d6 miscellaneous junk items (potential barter goods or crafting components). More gear depends on chosen Path (see Optional Systems) or background.

### Action Economy

During structured time (like combat or tense exploration):
*   **Turn:** Each character gets one turn per round.
*   **Actions:** On your turn, you can take:
    *   One **Movement Action:** Move up to your Speed (Agility x 5 meters approx). Difficult terrain costs double.
    *   One **Major Action:** Attack, use complex Tech-Magic, perform a challenging Skill check (Tinker, Heal, etc.), Aim (+1 die to next attack), Suppressing Fire.
    *   One **Minor Action:** Draw weapon, open door, speak a short phrase, drop prone, take simple cover.
*   **Reaction:** Once per round (even off-turn), you can use a Reaction in response to a trigger (e.g., Dodge: make Agility check vs Attack to negate hit; Parry: use melee weapon vs Attack).

## 2. Combat System

Combat is dangerous and often best avoided. When unavoidable, it's resolved turn-by-turn.

### Turn Structure

1.  **Determine Initiative:** All participants roll Agility + Perceive (TN 6). Highest number of Successes goes first, then descending order. Ties broken by Agility score, then Wits. GM can group similar NPCs/creatures for faster turns.
2.  **Take Turns:** Characters act in initiative order, taking Movement, Major, and Minor actions.
3.  **Round End:** Check for ongoing effects (Bleeding, Burning, Radiation). Start next round.

### Making Attacks

*   **Melee:** Roll **Might + Fight** vs. Target's Defense.
*   **Ranged:** Roll **Agility + Fight** vs. Target's Defense. Range affects difficulty (Point Blank: +1 die, Short: Standard, Medium: -1 die, Long: -2 dice).
*   **Hit:** If your roll meets or exceeds the required Successes (usually 2 for a basic hit), you hit.
*   **Damage:** Weapon Base Damage + 1 Damage per Success rolled *beyond* the required number.
*   **Armor:** Subtract Armor value from Damage dealt. Armor can be **Ablative** (reduces damage but gets damaged/destroyed after absorbing a certain amount) or **Hard** (consistent reduction). Tech-Magic armor might have special properties.

### Damage Types

*   **Physical:** Standard melee/impact damage. Reduced by most armor.
*   **Ballistic:** Damage from firearms ('Thunder Rods'). Often has higher base damage or armor-piercing qualities.
*   **Energy:** Lasers, plasma, electricity from Tech-Magic. Might ignore some conventional armor or have special effects (setting flammable materials alight, stunning). Reduced by specialized shielding or certain materials.
*   **Radiation (Rad):** Directly inflicts RP instead of HP damage. Bypasses most armor unless specifically shielded (rare). Sources: Glowlands, leaking Tech-Magic, specific mutant attacks.
*   **Biological (Bio):** Poisons, toxins, diseases from mutants or environmental hazards. Often deals damage over time or inflicts debilitating Conditions. Requires Grit or Heal checks to resist/recover.

### Critical Hits & Fumbles

*   **Critical Hit:** If an attack roll includes **3 or more 6s**, it's a critical hit. Maximize weapon damage (roll all damage dice and take the highest possible result) OR apply a special effect (e.g., disarm, target knocked prone, inflict Bleeding Condition, bypass some Armor).
*   **Fumble (Complication on Attack):** Rolling zero Successes and one or more 1s on an attack roll. Examples: Weapon jams/breaks, hit nearby ally, drop weapon, overextend leaving you vulnerable (-1 Defense until next turn).

### Conditions

Simple status effects (GM discretion for duration/removal):
*   **Bleeding:** Lose 1 HP per round until successful Heal check (Wits + Heal, 1 Success).
*   **Burning:** Take Energy damage each round, spreads to flammables. Requires action to extinguish.
*   **Stunned:** Cannot take Major Actions for 1 round.
*   **Pinned:** Cannot Move from cover due to suppressing fire. Requires Grit check or cessation of fire to remove.
*   **Irradiated:** Currently suffering effects from Rad Points threshold.
*   **Sick:** Penalty dice from disease or Bio Toxin. Requires Heal check or specific antidote.

## 3. Magic and Technology ('Tech-Magic')

Remnants of the Before Times are misunderstood, powerful, and dangerous.

### Identification

*   **Roll:** Wits + Intuit Tech. Difficulty set by GM based on tech complexity, condition, and obscurity (Easy 1 for simple tools, Standard 2 for common devices, Hard 3+ for complex/alien tech).
*   **Success:** Understand the basic function and intended use. More successes reveal more details (power source, potential risks, secondary functions).
*   **Failure:** Misidentify the object based on appearance or superstition. Leads to Misuse.
*   **Complication:** Misidentify *dangerously*, activating a harmful function or missing a critical warning sign.

### Activation & Use

*   **Activation:** May require finding a power source (batteries, charging stations, solar panels), specific actions (button sequence, voice command in lost language), or a **Wits + Tinker** check (Difficulty based on complexity/damage).
*   **Use:** Follows identified function. Some items require Skill checks to use effectively (e.g., Agility + Fight for Tech weapons). Simple items might just work.
*   **Superstition vs. Understanding:** Initial use is often based on incomplete knowledge ('superstitious use'). This might be inefficient or trigger risks more often. Spending time studying the item (requires downtime and successful Wits + Intuit Tech checks) can lead to 'true understanding', unlocking full potential and safer operation.

### Risks

Using Tech-Magic is inherently risky:
*   **Malfunction:** Triggered by:
    *   Complication on Activation/Use rolls.
    *   Attempting 'superstitious' or unintended uses.
    *   Using damaged or jury-rigged tech.
    *   GM discretion in high-stress situations or hazardous environments (e.g., Rad storm interference).
    *   **Malfunction Table (Roll d6):**
        1.  **Power Drain:** Depletes energy source partially or completely.
        2.  **Radiation Leak:** Releases burst of Rads (1d6 RP to user/nearby).
        3.  **System Crash:** Device becomes inert temporarily (1d6 rounds/minutes) or permanently until repaired (Tinker check).
        4.  **Unintended Effect:** Device does something related but unexpected (e.g., medical scanner emits blinding flash, comm device broadcasts location).
        5.  **Attracts Attention:** Emits loud noise, energy signature, or signal drawing nearby creatures, automated systems, or faction patrols.
        6.  **Catastrophic Failure:** Device violently breaks, explodes, or unleashes harmful energy (deals damage, creates hazard).
*   **Radiation Hazard:** Many Tech-Magic items contain decaying power sources or utilize radioactive materials. Handling or using them, especially if damaged, can inflict RP. Check item descriptions.
*   **Interaction with Twists:** Twists can affect Tech-Magic:
    *   *Benefit:* A mutation might allow innate interfacing (e.g., bio-electric field activates touch screens) or resistance (e.g., energy dampening skin reduces energy weapon damage).
    *   *Detriment:* A mutation might interfere with tech (e.g., magnetic field scrambles data), cause feedback loops (energy weapon overloads near energy-based mutant), or make the user more susceptible to certain effects (e.g., metallic growths attract electrical discharge). GM determines interactions based on narrative logic.

## 4. Optional Systems

These can be added for more campaign depth.

### Character Paths

Choose one at creation for flavor and minor mechanical benefits:
*   **Tech-Scavenger:** +1 Rank in Scavenge OR Tinker. Start with Basic Toolkit. Gets +1 die on rolls to identify or jury-rig common Tech-Magic.
*   **Twisted Warrior:** Start with one additional Minor Combat-Oriented Twist (GM approval). +1 Rank in Fight OR Grit. Often feared or ostracized, but resilient.
*   **Covenant Zealot:** +1 Rank in Persuade OR Intuit Tech (often misinterpreting). Starts with 'Sacred Relic' (mundane pre-Dimming item treated as holy) and basic knowledge of Covenant dogma/symbols. Gains +1 die when interacting with Covenant members (positively or negatively).
*   **Wasteland Survivalist:** +1 Rank in Survive OR Perceive. Starts with extra rations and basic environmental gear (filter mask, poncho). Gets +1 die on checks to resist environmental hazards (weather, non-Rad sickness).
*   **Keeper Initiate:** +1 Rank in Sneak OR Intimidate. Starts with knowledge of Keeper codes/hideouts. Gains +1 die on checks related to sabotaging Tech-Magic or navigating Glowlands (using hidden paths).

### Equipment Customization

*   **Salvaging:** Use **Wits + Scavenge** in ruins or from defeated foes to find Parts (generic) or specific Components (e.g., focusing lens, power coupling, scrap metal).
*   **Modifying:** Use **Wits + Tinker** (requires time, tools, and Parts/Components) to:
    *   Repair damaged gear/tech.
    *   Add mods to weapons (scope: +1 die Aiming; extended mag: more ammo; silencer: harder to detect).
    *   Improve armor (extra padding: +1 Armor, ablative; reinforcement: upgrade Armor type).
    *   Enhance Tech-Magic (increase efficiency, add minor function, overcharge for risk/reward).
    *   **Risk:** Failure on Tinker check wastes Parts. Complication might damage the item, introduce a Flaw (e.g., jams more often), or cause immediate Malfunction.

### Faction Reputation

*   Track Reputation with major factions (Lumen Covenant, Rust Lords, Keepers of Static, major settlements) on a scale from -3 (Hated) to +3 (Trusted). Starts at 0.
*   Adjusted by completing quests, making significant choices impacting the faction, or open displays of allegiance/hostility.
*   **Effects:**
    *   **Positive Rep:** Access to safe houses, better prices from faction traders, receive faction-specific quests, potential backup in dangerous situations.
    *   **Negative Rep:** Higher prices or refusal of service, ambushes by faction agents, restricted access to faction territory, targeted by faction operations.
    *   Reputation can influence NPC reactions and open/close narrative paths.

## 5. Edge Cases & Resolution Guidelines

*   **Tech-Magic Misuse (Superstition):** Player insists on using tech based on flawed belief (e.g., using a data chip as a protective ward).
    *   **Resolution:** Usually, it has no effect. If the action could conceivably interact with the tech's actual function, GM determines a logical (often negative) outcome. Ex: Waving a live power cell like a torch might cause it to short out or explode (Malfunction roll). Trying to 'heal' with a cutting tool causes obvious harm. Reward players who deduce the *real* function.
*   **Severe Glowland Exposure:** Entering deep Glowlands or caught in Rad-Storms without protection.
    *   **Resolution:** Requires frequent Grit + Survive checks (Difficulty 2-3+). Failure inflicts RP (1d3 or more). Complications might mean losing gear, getting lost, or encountering mutated horrors drawn to the radiation. Protective gear might reduce frequency/severity of checks or RP gain. Accumulating RP leads to Sickness and potential Twists as per Core Mechanics.
*   **Unexpected Twist Interaction:** A new Twist interacts strangely with existing ones or the environment.
    *   **Resolution:** GM narrates the emergent effect based on the involved elements. Could be temporary, situational, or require a check (Grit?) to control. Ex: A character with *Chameleon Skin* enters an area with flickering Tech-Magic light, causing uncontrollable, distracting color shifts (-1 die Sneak). Player ingenuity in using combined Twist effects should sometimes be rewarded.
*   **Faction Conflict Escalation:** Player actions turn a neutral faction hostile, or pit two allied factions against each other.
    *   **Resolution:** Treat as a major narrative development. Hostile factions actively work against players (ambushes, sabotage, bounties). Conflicting allies might force the player to choose sides, mediate (difficult Charm/Persuade checks), or face consequences from both. Reputation shifts dramatically.
*   **Running Out of Resources:** Food, water, ammo, power cells depleted far from sanctuary.
    *   **Resolution:** Emphasize Grit & Survival. Starvation/dehydration impose escalating penalties (dice penalties, HP loss). Lack of ammo forces reliance on melee/improvised weapons. Dead tech is just junk. This should spur desperate Scavenging runs, risky trades, or targeting resource-rich locations/enemies. Makes resource management meaningful.
*   **Discovering 'True' Function:** Player figures out a piece of Tech-Magic is far more complex/dangerous than previously assumed (e.g., 'Rain Stick' is a weather control device).
    *   **Resolution:** Treat as a major discovery. May require further Wits + Intuit Tech/Tinker checks to fully understand or control. Unlocks new capabilities but likely draws unwanted attention (factions, automated systems) and carries significant risks if misused (Malfunction table severity might increase). This directly feeds into the Rediscovery vs. Misinterpretation theme.
