# Faunora Character System

## Character Creation Overview

Character creation in Faunora involves choosing a Species (granting innate Species Traits and potential Attribute modifiers), selecting a Background (providing narrative hooks, starting gear, and minor skill/contact benefits), determining Core Attributes (Might, Agility, Vitality, Instinct, Intellect, Presence) using a standard array or point buy, allocating Skill Points (based on Intellect) into various Skills and Specializations, potentially selecting an initial Tier 1 Evolved Trait (if applicable), calculating Derived Stats (Wounds, Defense, Stamina Points, etc.), and noting starting equipment and relationships. Advancement uses a Milestone system, granting Skill Points, Trait Points (for Evolved Traits), and Evolution Points (for upgrading traits) at significant narrative junctures.

### Character Creation Steps

1.  **Concept & Species Selection**: Choose an animal species, note its Species Traits (Size, Movement, Senses, Natural Weapons/Armor, Special Abilities, Attribute Modifiers).
2.  **Background Choice**: Select a Background, note its narrative elements, starting equipment/currency, bonus Skill Ranks/Proficiencies, and Background Feature.
3.  **Attribute Allocation**: Assign scores to MGT, AGL, VIT, INS, INT, PRS using Standard Array \[4,3,3,2,2,1] or Point Buy (7 points from base 1, max 4). Apply Species Attribute Modifiers.
4.  **Skill Point Allocation**: Calculate starting Skill Points (10 + INT). Spend points to increase Skill Ranks (cost = new rank) and choose Specializations (+1d10 bonus die when applicable). Note Species Affinity skills (free Rank 1). Max starting rank is 3.
5.  **Evolved Trait Selection (Optional)**: If applicable (Vanguard/Marauder/specific Background), choose one Tier 1 Evolved Trait.
6.  **Calculate Derived Stats**: Determine Wound Levels (based on VIT + Size Mod), Defense (5 + AGL + Size Mod), Max Stamina Points (VIT + INS), Initiative (1d10 + INS), Movement Speeds (from Species), Melee Damage Bonus (MGT/2).
7.  **Starting Equipment & Relationships**: List equipment from Background and any basic species needs. Note starting Relationship score from Background.
8.  **Final Details**: Name, appearance, personality, goals, flaws, connections.

## Core Attributes and Stats

### Core Attributes

*   **Might (MGT)**: Raw physical power, muscular force, lifting/carrying capacity, crushing/biting strength, imposing physical presence. Governs melee damage, carrying capacity. *Range: Typically 1-5 for PCs.*
*   **Agility (AGL)**: Dexterity, speed, balance, coordination, reaction time, fine manipulation skills. Governs Defense, ranged/finesse attacks, piloting, stealth. *Range: Typically 1-5 for PCs.*
*   **Vitality (VIT)**: Health, toughness, resilience, stamina, resistance to physical hardship (poison, disease, fatigue, injury). Governs Wound Levels, Stamina Points. *Range: Typically 1-5 for PCs.*
*   **Instinct (INS)**: Awareness, perception (all relevant senses), intuition, willpower, focus, reaction speed. Governs Initiative, Stamina Points, perception/willpower skills. *Range: Typically 1-5 for PCs.*
*   **Intellect (INT)**: Reasoning, memory, learning capacity, knowledge, problem-solving, understanding complex systems. Governs Skill Points, knowledge/tech skills. *Range: Typically 1-5 for PCs.*
*   **Presence (PRS)**: Social influence, charisma, leadership, intimidation, deception, performance, command attention. Governs social skills. *Range: Typically 1-5 for PCs.*

### Attribute Allocation Methods

*   **Standard Array**: \[4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1] assigned to attributes before species modifiers.
*   **Point Buy**: 7 points to distribute from a base of 1 in each attribute, max starting score 4 before species modifiers.

### Derived Stats

*   **Wound Levels**: Track of worsening penalties: Healthy -> Grazed (-1d10 penalty) -> Hurt (-2d10 penalty) -> Mauled (-4d10 penalty) -> Incapacitated.
    *   *Calculation*: Damage threshold per step = VIT + Size Modifier (minimum 1). Size Modifiers: Tiny -1, Small 0, Medium 0, Large +1, Huge +2 (adjust as needed).
*   **Defense**: Difficulty to hit effectively.
    *   *Calculation*: Base Defense = 5 + AGL + Size Modifier. Modifiers from cover, armor (may add dice to resist damage instead).
*   **Stamina Points (SP)**: Energy/focus pool for Evolved Traits.
    *   *Calculation*: Max SP = VIT + INS. (Note: Advancement section modifies this to VIT + INS + Level).
    *   *Recovery*: Typically recovers with rest (e.g., 1 SP/10 min, full on long rest).
*   **Initiative**: Reaction speed.
    *   *Calculation*: Roll 1d10 + INS. Ties broken by INS, then AGL.
*   **Movement Speed**: Speed for different modes (Walk, Fly, Swim, Climb, Burrow).
    *   *Calculation*: Base speeds determined by Species Template. Difficult terrain halves speed.
*   **Melee Damage Bonus**: Extra damage from physical power.
    *   *Calculation*: Add MGT / 2 (rounded up, min 0) to melee damage rolls.
