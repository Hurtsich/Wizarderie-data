# Welcome to Faunora

Faunora is a world teeming with life, where countless animal species have achieved sapience, building civilizations that range from sprawling subterranean metropolises to glittering cities nestled high in rainforest canopies or deep beneath the waves. It is a world shaped by its unique geography, the echoes of its tumultuous past, and the emergence of extraordinary abilities known as Evolved Traits.

## The World of Faunora

Faunora's landmass consists of a single supercontinent, Pangaea Ultima, encircled by the vast global ocean, the Great Blue. This unique geography dictates much of the world's climate and the distribution of its diverse biomes.

### Geography and Climate

The continent boasts a stunning variety of environments:

*   **The Verdant Heart:** A colossal, multi-layered rainforest dominating the equator. Sunlight struggles to reach the forest floor through the dense canopy, which supports towering arboreal cities. Rainfall is near-constant.
*   **The Great Plains:** Expansive temperate grasslands and savannas stretch across vast distances, crossed by wide rivers. These plains are vital for the **Great Migration Festival** and host numerous ground-level settlements.
*   **Whispering Peaks:** A formidable mountain range dividing east from west, known for its sharp peaks, deep valleys, howling winds, and extensive cave networks. It's home to avian cities like **Aethelburg** and hardy mountain dwellers. The peaks create a significant rain shadow effect on their leeward side.
*   **Sunken Territories:** Along the southern coast lie vast wetlands, swamps, and bayous, transitioning into mangrove forests and shallow seas. This region is ideal for amphibious and semi-aquatic life and holds the ruins of the **Sunken City of Ss'thar**.
*   **The Crystal Deeps:** Beyond the continental shelf, the ocean floor plunges into deep trenches. Here, unique abyssal cultures thrive amidst bioluminescent ecosystems and hydrothermal vents, like those found near **Coral Spire** and the dangerous **Marauder's Trench**.
*   **Shivering Expanse:** The northern reaches are dominated by tundra and taiga, characterized by permafrost, coniferous forests, and long, dark winters. Survival often depends on subterranean networks and geothermal heat, such as found in **The Shivering Expanse Geothermal Hub**.
*   **Scorched Basin:** A large desert region featuring dunes, rocky outcrops, and surprisingly resilient life adapted to arid conditions. Much activity here occurs nocturnally.

Faunora's climate is generally Earth-like but experiences more pronounced seasons due to the single landmass. Ocean currents are crucial regulators, and managing the global climate is a significant technological and political challenge.

### Key Environments

Beyond the major biomes, specific unique environments shape life:

*   **Giant Sequoia Forests:** Support colossal arboreal structures within the Verdant Heart.
*   **Coral Megalopolises:** Built upon massive, ancient reefs in the Crystal Deeps, exemplified by **Coral Spire**.
*   **Geothermal Vents:** Power deep-sea and subterranean cities like **Deep Burrow** and the **Shivering Expanse Geothermal Hub**.
*   **Floating Kelp Forests:** Sustain nomadic aquatic communities in the Great Blue.
*   **Salt Flats:** Rich in minerals but perilous to cross.

## A History Forged in Instinct and Accord

Faunora's history is a dramatic tapestry woven from the threads of sudden consciousness, instinctual conflict, and the eventual, fragile establishment of peace.

*   **The Great Awakening (c. 10,000 cycles ago):** A mysterious period marking the rapid, widespread emergence of sapience across numerous animal species. The exact cause remains one of Faunora's greatest **Secrets and Legends**, with theories ranging from natural phenomena to external influence. This era saw chaotic first contacts and the birth of rudimentary societies.
*   **The Predation Wars (c. 8,000 - 5,000 cycles ago):** Centuries of brutal conflict ensued as newly sapient species grappled with ingrained predator-prey instincts and competed fiercely for resources. These wars hindered progress and led to widespread suffering and enslavement. Some **Lost Species** may date back to this era.
*   **The Great Accord (c. 5,000 cycles ago):** Visionaries from diverse species negotiated a landmark series of treaties. The Accord outlawed predatory hunting among sapient species, established fundamental rights, and laid the foundation for cooperative, multi-species societies. Enforcement was initially challenging but marked a turning point towards civilization.
*   **The Emergence (c. 500 cycles ago):** A significant surge in the frequency and power of **Evolved Traits** – extraordinary abilities manifesting in individuals. This event drastically reshaped society, warfare, and daily life, leading to the rise of both heroes and villains. The nature and origin of these traits are still debated (**Secrets and Legends**).
*   **The First Vanguard/Marauder Conflict ('The Crimson Season', c. 150 cycles ago):** The first organized groups of **Marauders** used their potent Evolved Traits for large-scale crime, plunging Faunora into chaos. This crisis directly led to the formation of the **Vanguard Alliance** to uphold the Great Accord and protect civilians, establishing the ongoing dynamic between super-powered protectors and criminals.

## Society, Culture, and Communication

Life in Faunora is a complex interplay of diverse species, evolving social structures, and unique cultural expressions.

### Species Interaction and Social Structures

The **Great Accord** formally governs interspecies relations, but historical predator/prey dynamics create lingering biases and friction. Mixed-species cities like **Rustlemarket** are common, often featuring specialized districts (aquatic zones, high-canopy levels, burrow networks) to accommodate different physiologies. Interspecies relationships exist but can face social challenges.

Class systems are primarily based on:

*   **Resource Access:** Control over vital resources grants significant influence.
*   **Evolved Trait Status:** Individuals with powerful traits (**Vanguards**) often gain celebrity status, while those deemed dangerous (**Marauders**) face suspicion. The majority possess less significant or no traits.
*   **Species Niche:** Certain species may dominate industries suited to their innate abilities (e.g., weaver birds in construction, beavers in engineering), creating economic strata.

Political power often resides in multi-species councils. Charismatic individuals, powerful Vanguards like **Ursa Major**, or economic leaders (Beaver Dam Barons, Spider Silk Magnates) wield considerable soft power. Factions like the **Species Purity League** constantly vie for influence, sometimes exploiting old biases. Species with longer lifespans (tortoises like **Master Odon**, parrots) often hold positions requiring long-term perspective, though this can lead to accusations of stagnation.

### Languages and Communication

While countless species-specific communication methods exist, interspecies dialogue relies on:

*   **Common Tongue (Growl-Chirp):** A synthesized language developed post-Accord, translated via ubiquitous personal communicator devices (PCDs). It blends mammalian and avian phonetics.
*   **Deep Speak (Click-Pulse):** Used in aquatic (**Crystal Deeps**) and subterranean (**Deep Burrow**) environments, relying on sonar, clicks, and bioluminescence. Requires specialized translators.
*   **Silent Cant (Scent-Sign):** Combines pheromones and sign language, common among insectoid and some reptilian/amphibian species. Often requires technological aids for others.

### Customs and Traditions

Faunora celebrates a rich tapestry of species-specific traditions:

*   **Great Migration Festival:** Annual mass travel, feasting, and cultural exchange along designated corridors on the **Great Migration Plains**.
*   **Deep Bloom Ball:** Bioluminescent displays and courtship rituals in the **Crystal Deeps** during plankton blooms.
*   **Molt Fairs:** Communal support and trade events for molting species.
*   **Hibernation Gala:** Pre-hibernation feasts and resource sharing in colder regions like the **Shivering Expanse**.
*   **Sky-Dances:** Complex aerial displays for social bonding and ceremony, often near the **Whispering Peaks** and **Aethelburg**.
*   **Burrow-Moots:** Underground community gatherings for governance and resource discussion in places like **Deep Burrow**.

## Economy: Sparks, Trade Routes, and Resources

Faunora's economy is as diverse as its inhabitants, utilizing specialized trade networks and relying on unique resources.

### Trade Networks

Goods move via highly adapted systems:

*   **Sky-Lanes:** Designated aerial routes for flyers.
*   **River-Ways & Sea-Routes:** For aquatic/semi-aquatic transport, including submersibles.
*   **Tunnel-Ways:** Extensive underground freight networks.
*   **Canopy-Rails:** Transport systems through forest canopies like in **Veridia**.
*   **Overland Caravans:** Still used on the **Great Plains**.

**Rustlemarket** serves as a major intersection for many of these networks.

### Resources and Currency

Key resources fueling the economy include Bioluminescent Algae (power), Giant Bamboo & Ironwood (construction), Deep-Sea Nodules (metals), Gossamer Silk (textiles), Ambergris & Rare Nectars (luxury/biochemicals), and Geothermal/Hydro-Power. Resource disputes are frequent.

The standard digital currency is the **'Spark' (Ψ)**, managed by the Inter-Species Banking Cooperative (ISBC). Physical tokens (polished shells, carved hardwood) are used for smaller transactions or in low-tech areas. Barter persists for unique species-produced goods.
