The art style will be **hyper-realistic and richly detailed**, aiming for a **cinematic, photorealistic quality** that dramatically highlights the clash between two realities. **Lighting** will be intensely high-contrast, juxtaposing the sterile, bright, and volumetric artificial glows of VIGIL's surveilled surface with the deep, atmospheric shadows, natural textures, and mystical arcane luminescence of the Lign√©es' hidden, ancient depths. **Colors** will feature a cool, desaturated palette with vibrant, artificial neon and holographic accents for the technological world, sharply contrasted by muted earth tones and rich, otherworldly magical hues (deep purples, emerald greens, sanguine reds) for the occult. **Compositions** will alternate between expansive, pristine cityscapes emphasizing omnipresent order, and intimate, claustrophobic subterranean scenes that focus on secrecy and tactile detail, always evoking a mood of sleek, oppressive futurism meeting ancient, raw, and defiant mysticism.
