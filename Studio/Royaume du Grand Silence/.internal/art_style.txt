A high-quality, detailed **Dreamspun Anime & Manga style** will define the illustrations, characterized by its emotional depth and striking visual contrasts. **Lighting** will be dynamic and expressive, shifting from the harsh, cold, and stark artificial illumination of the Cités de la Raison to warm, ethereal glows and dappled sunlight that imbue the Sanctuaires Sylvestres and Royaumes Oniriques Oubliés. The **color palette** will be poignantly curated, featuring an overriding base of desaturated greys, cool blues, and muted earth tones for the oppressive world, sharply contrasted by vibrant, saturated bursts of color for Jouvencels, magical effects, and the untouched pockets of imagination. **Compositions** will be dynamic and emotionally driven, blending the geometric precision of the Épurateurs' architecture with the organic, fantastical elements of the forgotten world, often employing unique perspectives and a sense of depth. **The mood** will evoke a delicate balance of wistful melancholy and resilient hope, capturing the inherent sadness of a fading world while celebrating the enduring spark of wonder and imagination through expressive anime features and detailed environmental storytelling.
