# Flavor Ghoul

### Description & Lore
The Flavor Ghoul is a spectral entity born from the residual Flavorweave of dishes that have been left to spoil, dishes prepared with malevolent intent, or simply magnificent meals that have lost their spark over time. It appears as a translucent, shimmering vapor, vaguely humanoid or serpentine, often swirling with a faint, sickly grey-green hue – the color of culinary neglect. It has no discernible features other than faint, glowing pinpricks where eyes might be. In Aromaville, where the Flavorweave runs rich and powerful, ghouls are an unfortunate, though thankfully rare, consequence of the city's prodigious culinary output. Locals perceive them as a kitchen curse, a bad omen, or a manifestation of wasted potential. Many believe a Flavor Ghoul is a dish's lingering spirit, consumed by bitterness after being forgotten or created without love. Some whisper they are drawn to the echoes of the Whispering Truffle, trying to taste the ancient Umami it once possessed, only to find perpetual emptiness and leave a trail of despoiled food in their wake.

### Behavior & Tactics
Flavor Ghouls are shy and non-aggressive by nature, seeking only to satiate their unending, spectral hunger for lingering Flavorweave. They are typically found in neglected pantries, forgotten cellars, or kitchens after hours, drawn by the scent of recently prepared, magically potent food. They glide silently through solid objects, avoiding direct confrontation. When a ghoul encounters a dish, it attempts to "feed" by passing through it, draining its flavor and magical essence. If cornered or directly threatened, a ghoul will emit a chilling wave of blandness – a sudden, nauseating lack of taste – or attempt to phase rapidly away, making it incredibly difficult to pin down. They are particularly repelled by strong, fresh aromas and active, vibrant Flavorweave magic, which causes them discomfort.

### Game Mechanics (as an NPC)

*   **Aspects:**
    *   **High Concept:** Ethereal Hunger for Culinary Echoes
    *   **Trouble:** Repelled by Vibrant Flavor and Freshness
    *   Whispers of Forgotten Tastes
    *   Dread of the Empty Palate

*   **Skills:**
    *   `Stealth` +4 (Expert at slipping unnoticed)
    *   `Athletics` +3 (For gliding and phasing)
    *   `Notice` +2 (To detect residual Flavorweave)
    *   `Will` +1 (To resist banishment attempts)

*   **Stunts:**
    *   **Flavor Drain:** When the Flavor Ghoul successfully *Overcomes* a prepared dish with its `Stealth` or `Will` (representing its insidious nature), it attaches the `Tasteless & Bland` aspect to the food with one free invocation. Dishes affected by this stunt lose all magical properties, nutritional value, and become utterly unappetizing. This effect is permanent unless countered by powerful culinary magic.
    *   **Ethereal Glide:** The Flavor Ghoul can move through solid objects like walls, doors, and crates, provided they are not imbued with significant active Flavorweave magic. This makes it very difficult to trap or physically attack.
    *   **Wave of Blandness:** Once per exchange, as an action, the Flavor Ghoul can create a zone of profound tastelessness. Anyone caught in the zone must succeed on a `Will` roll (difficulty equal to the ghoul's `Stealth` skill) or suffer a `-1` to all `Craft` or `Empathy` rolls for their next turn as their senses are dulled by the oppressive lack of flavor.
