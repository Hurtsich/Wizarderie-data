### Description & Lore

Spicewing Bats are small, captivating creatures, no larger than a Chef-Adventurer's hand, distinguished by their gossamer-thin, iridescent wings that shimmer with the vibrant hues of the spices they consume. Their fur is a soft, deep indigo, contrasting with bright, inquisitive eyes that seem to dart with an insatiable hunger for flavor. They are endemic to bustling culinary centers like Aromaville, having evolved to directly metabolize the potent Flavorweave within rare spices. While largely considered mischievous pests due to their brazen thievery from market stalls and outdoor kitchens, some older vendors whisper that a cluster of Spicewings is a reliable sign of truly potent, Flavorweave-rich ingredients nearby. Their signature trait is the fine, shimmering dust they shed, a magical byproduct of their spice-rich diet, which causes an involuntary, magically-induced sneeze in anyone who inhales it. This dust is sometimes carefully collected by alchemists for very specific, minor magical seasoning components, believed to briefly enhance the perception of taste.

### Behavior & Tactics

Spicewing Bats are inherently shy of direct confrontation, preferring opportunistic, hit-and-run tactics. They are intensely attracted to the most magically potent and aromatic spices, especially those emanating strong Flavorweave signatures, often ignoring less potent ingredients entirely. They operate primarily in twilight or low-light conditions, though their boldness in Aromaville's perpetually busy markets means they are often seen during the day, flitting among awnings and rafters. When attempting a theft, a single bat will often scout, then signal a small swarm (2-5 individuals). Their primary defensive tactic is to confuse and disorient opponents by rapidly flitting around their heads in tight, erratic patterns and releasing bursts of their signature sneezing dust. They will snatch a small packet of spice, a single fruit, or a precious herb, and swiftly retreat, utilizing their incredible agility to navigate tight spaces and escape through narrow gaps. They do not engage in prolonged combat but will occasionally nip at exposed hands or fingers if cornered or if their pilfered prize is contested.

### Game Mechanics (as an NPC)

*   **Aspects:**
    *   **High Concept:** Iridescent Spice-Snatching Pest of Aromaville
    *   **Trouble/Flaw:** Overly Enticed by Potent Flavorweave
    *   Cloud of Sneezing Dust
    *   Quick-Winged Market Thief

*   **Skills:**
    *   **Athletics:** +3 (Agile fliers, adept at dodging)
    *   **Stealth:** +2 (Masterful at snatching unnoticed, despite their shimmer)
    *   **Notice:** +1 (Keen senses for detecting powerful flavors and threats)
    *   **Fight:** +0 (Not combatants, only nips defensively)

*   **Stunts:**
    *   **Sneezing Cloud:** When a Spicewing Bat successfully creates an advantage (using Athletics to disorient, or Stealth to vanish) or defends against an opponent who is adjacent, it can choose to release a burst of sneezing dust. The target must succeed on an **Athletics** or **Will** roll (against the bat's **Athletics** skill) to resist the magical compulsion. On a failure, they take a 'Violently Sneezing' aspect with one free invocation. This aspect makes it harder for them to concentrate (-2 to their next overcome/create advantage/attack actions for one exchange).

*   **Stress:**
    *   Physical Stress: [ ][ ] (2 boxes)

*   **Consequences:**
    *   Can take one Mild consequence.
