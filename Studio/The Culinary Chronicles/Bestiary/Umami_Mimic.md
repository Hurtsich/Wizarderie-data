# Umami Mimic

## Description & Lore
The Umami Mimic is a peculiar, often maddening, creature native to areas rich in Flavorweave, particularly the ingredient storage cellars and bustling markets of Aromaville. In its true form, it is a translucent, shimmering blob of pale amber jelly, roughly the size of a human head, though it can expand or contract slightly. Its most striking feature is its perfect chameleon-like ability; it can effortlessly replicate the exact appearance, texture, and even subtle aroma of any rare ingredient it wishes to absorb. It preys solely on the concentrated magical essence, the Flavorweave, found within high-quality food.

Lore suggests that Umami Mimics are a byproduct of the unstable, residual Umami Flavorweave that lingered after the near-destruction of Aromaville during **The Great Spat**, possibly even an echo of the fabled Whispering Truffle itself. They are a constant nuisance to Chef-Adventurers, spoiling precious ingredients and occasionally leading to embarrassing culinary blunders when a mimic is unknowingly used in a dish. Locals perceive them as clever, frustrating pests, a test of a chef's sensory perception and wisdom, and a reminder that even the most vital ingredients can be fleeting. It is said that those who accidentally consume a mimic's flavor-drained husk become temporarily insensate to taste, a fitting curse for a creature that steals the very essence of flavor.

## Behavior & Tactics
Umami Mimics are not aggressive combatants, but cunning and opportunistic scavengers. Their primary goal is to find and siphon Flavorweave from the most potent and rare ingredients. They are masters of infiltration, often slipping into storage areas, market stalls, or even adventurer's packs undetected. Once nestled among valuable ingredients, they will perfectly mimic the most tempting item, subtly drawing the Flavorweave from it over time, leaving behind a dull, inert husk.

If discovered or directly threatened, an Umami Mimic's first instinct is to escape. It uses its mimicry to momentarily confuse pursuers, perhaps by replicating several common items at once, blending seamlessly into a pile of goods, or even creating a fleeting illusion of another creature to distract. While not a fighter, a cornered mimic might lash out with a pseudopod that exudes a wave of sickening blandness, inducing momentary nausea in its attacker, allowing it to flee.
