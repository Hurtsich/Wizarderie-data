# Agent 'Synthex' Zero

## Roleplaying Cues

*   **Appearance & Demeanor:** Agent Zero is a figure of stark, clinical efficiency. They stand at an average height, draped in a form-fitting, charcoal-grey uniform emblazoned with subtle NutriCorp insignias. Their movements are precise, almost robotic, lacking any unnecessary flourish. A polished visor, often kept down, conceals their eyes, reflecting their surroundings with an unnerving, impersonal glare. When they do speak, their voice is a synthesized monotone, devoid of inflection, delivering facts and directives with unyielding authority. They emit a faint, sterile scent, a stark contrast to the aromatic world they seek to control.
*   **Goal:** Agent Zero's primary goal is the systematic eradication of 'flavor chaos' and the complete integration of global food production under NutriCorp's synthetic banner. They are driven to identify, acquire (through any means necessary), and either neutralize or standardize all traditional recipes and unique ingredients, believing they bring instability and inefficiency to the world. Their immediate objective is often to disrupt Chef-Adventurer operations and secure specific 'legacy' culinary assets for the Flavor Abatement Division.
*   **Faction Affiliation:** Agent Zero is a high-ranking and fanatically loyal operative of the **Flavor Abatement Division**, NutriCorp's clandestine enforcement arm. They see themselves as a crusader for a 'superior' nutritional future, viewing traditional food as an archaic, unhygienic, and dangerously inefficient relic. They are deeply indoctrinated into NutriCorp's ideology, holding a position of significant authority in field operations against 'flavor rebels'.
*   **Loves:** Agent Zero 'loves' perfect efficiency, flawless data, and the absolute control that synthetic nutrition represents. They admire NutriCorp's vision of a predictable, homogenous world, free from the 'distractions' of taste and emotion. Perhaps they also have a peculiar fascination with the intricate machinery within Nutrient Vats, seeing them as temples of progress and order.
*   **Fears:** Their greatest fear is the inherent unpredictability and 'corrupting' influence of true, natural flavor. They fear losing control, succumbing to sensory overload, or failing to meet NutriCorp's rigorous standards. The idea of traditional cuisine undermining the corporate order, or worse, personally experiencing and enjoying a truly delicious dish, is an existential threat to their worldview and identity.

    *   **Recipe Data Extract (Lore):** When you successfully use Lore to identify a traditional recipe or ingredient, you may spend a Fate Point to immediately create an Aspect on it, such as "Digitally Scannable for NutriCorp Archives" with a free invocation, making it easier to acquire or replicate later in synthetic form.
