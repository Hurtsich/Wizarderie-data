# Alistair 'Apex' Thorne

## Roleplaying Cues

*   **Appearance & Demeanor:** Alistair Thorne is impeccably groomed, favoring crisp, minimalist suits that reflect NutriCorp's sterile aesthetic. His presence is magnetic, exuding confidence and a persuasive calm. He moves with an efficient grace, his gaze sharp and calculating, rarely betraying emotion beyond a practiced, genial smile. Beneath the charming facade, there's an undeniable ruthlessness, a man who sees the world as a problem to be optimized.
*   **Goal:** To establish NutriCorp's synthetic food as the sole, globally accepted standard for sustenance, eliminating traditional cuisine and the unpredictable Flavorweave entirely. He seeks to exert absolute control over global food production and consumption, ushering in what he genuinely believes is a more "ordered, efficient, and equitable" future.
*   **Faction Affiliation:** CEO of **NutriCorp (Global Nutrient Corporation)**. He is the mastermind behind its public image and corporate strategy, and secretly the primary architect of its deeper, more insidious agenda. He directly oversees and funds the clandestine operations of the **Flavor Abatement Division**, using their extreme methods to systematically dismantle traditional food cultures and steal ancient recipes.
*   **Loves:** The concept of absolute control and predictability. He cherishes the sterile perfection of NutriCorp's laboratories and the mathematical precision of synthetic nutrition. He is driven by his grand, albeit terrifying, vision of a world free from the "chaos" of natural flavors, where every nutrient is accounted for and every stomach satisfied by his corporation.
*   **Fears:** Loss of control, chaos, and the unpredictable power of the Flavorweave. He is terrified of anything that defies his systems, especially the passionate, unquantifiable joy and magic found in traditional cuisine. His greatest personal fear is the public exposure of his complicity with the Flavor Abatement Division, which would shatter his carefully crafted image and threaten NutriCorp's global legitimacy.

### Stunts

*   **Corporate Leverage (Resources):** Gain +2 to Resources rolls when attempting to acquire specific information, disrupt a rival's supply chain, or put pressure on an organization through financial or political means.
*   **Synthetic Palate (Lore):** You gain +2 to Lore rolls when analyzing any food product (natural or synthetic) for its nutritional composition, potential contaminants, or unique chemical signature. You can also use Lore instead of Culinary Craft to identify the precise synthetic components of any NutriCorp product.
*   **Flavor Abatement Protocol (Provoke):** Once per session, when an opponent is enjoying a traditional, flavorful dish, you can use Provoke to highlight its "inefficiency, unsanitary origin, or nutritional imbalance." If successful, you create a "Questionable Culinary Choices" Aspect on the opponent with a free invocation, potentially undermining their confidence or enjoyment.
