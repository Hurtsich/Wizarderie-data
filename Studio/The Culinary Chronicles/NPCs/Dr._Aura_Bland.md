# Dr. Aura Bland - Lead Scientist of the Flavor Abatement Division

## Roleplaying Cues

*   **Appearance & Demeanor:** Dr. Aura Bland is a woman of precise angles and muted colors. Her lab coat is always impeccably white, her sleek grey hair pulled back in a severe bun. She moves with an almost robotic efficiency, her voice a cool, modulated tone devoid of inflection. Her eyes, behind thin, frameless glasses, hold an intense, calculating glint, rarely betraying emotion. She views the world through a lens of data and quantifiable inputs, finding "flavor" to be an inconvenient, unpredictable variable. Her demeanor is one of superior intellect and quiet disdain for anything she considers "inefficient" or "unscientific," often expressing a barely concealed impatience with traditional culinary arts.

*   **Goal:** Her primary goal is to perfect the Flavorweave siphoning technology, achieving complete and permanent control over the world's inherent magical essence. She believes that by eradicating the "chaos" of natural flavor and unpredictable culinary magic, she can usher in an era of perfect nutritional efficiency and global food stability under NutriCorp's control. She envisions a future where all food is perfectly synthesized, predictable, and entirely devoid of the "sentimental nonsense" of taste. She is currently focused on developing a universal blandness agent that can neutralize any flavor, magical or otherwise.

*   **Faction Affiliation:** Dr. Aura Bland is the brilliant and unyieldingly loyal Lead Scientist of the Flavor Abatement Division within NutriCorp. She is absolutely devoted to NutriCorp's mission, seeing it as the logical and scientific evolution of food. She holds considerable authority within her division, directing numerous projects and research teams dedicated to developing synthetic foods and flavor suppression technologies. Her loyalty is unwavering, born of a genuine (if misguided) belief in the corporation's vision and her own scientific prowess. She often acts as the intellectual spearhead for NutriCorp's more insidious initiatives.

*   **Loves:** She loves data, efficiency, controlled experiments, and the elegant simplicity of a perfectly calibrated synthetic nutrient formula. She takes immense pride in her technological breakthroughs, especially the intricate mechanisms of her Flavorweave siphons and blandness emitters. There is a quiet, almost cold satisfaction she derives from demonstrating the "superiority" of scientific control over natural unpredictability. She also holds a deep, intellectual affection for her advanced laboratory equipment and the flawless operation of her automated nutrient farms.

*   **Fears:** Dr. Bland's greatest fear is the inherent unpredictability of the Flavorweave itself. She fears a culinary magic she cannot quantify, control, or replicate. She is terrified of a world consumed by "flavor anarchy," where ingredients act independently of scientific law and human emotions cloud objective judgment. She also secretly fears her own personal history of having a "sensitive palate" in childhood, which she repressed through rigorous scientific discipline; she views this past as a weakness that must never resurface. The idea of losing control over her projects, or being proven wrong by the chaotic nature of taste, is deeply unsettling to her.

## Game Mechanics

*   **Aspects:**
    *   **High Concept:** Brilliant Architect of Blandness for the Flavor Abatement Division
    *   **Trouble:** My Own Palate is a Ghost I Cannot Exorcise
    *   **Obsessed with Eradicating Culinary "Chaos"**
    *   **NutriCorp's Resources are My Personal Playground**
    *   **The Flavorweave is a Problem to be Solved, Not Celebrated**

*   **Skills:**
    *   **Great (+4):** Investigate
    *   **Good (+3):** Resources, Will
    *   **Fair (+2):** Lore, Rapport, Culinary Craft
    *   **Average (+1):** Notice, Physique, Deceive, Provoke

*   **Stunts:**
    *   **Flavorweave Suppressor (Investigate):** Due to your specialized knowledge of Flavorweave mechanics, you gain +2 to Investigate rolls when attempting to identify, analyze, or directly interfere with magical effects derived from natural ingredients or culinary magic. You can spend a Fate Point on a successful roll to create a "Flavorweave Instability" Aspect on the target or area with one free invocation.
    *   **Engineered Apathy (Culinary Craft):** When you successfully create a synthetic food product designed for blandness, you can invoke its "NutriCorp Standardized Flavor" Aspect to make one target feel less motivated or enthusiastic about culinary experiences, gaining +2 to any subsequent Rapport or Provoke rolls against them regarding flavor versus efficiency.
    *   **Nutrient Scan Protocol (Notice):** You can use Notice instead of Gastronomic Lore to instantly determine the complete nutritional breakdown, caloric content, and any synthetic components of any food item, natural or manufactured. If the item is synthetic, you also learn its precise manufacturing origin and manufacturing date.

*   **Stress:**
    *   Physical: [1][2]
    *   Mental: [1][2]
