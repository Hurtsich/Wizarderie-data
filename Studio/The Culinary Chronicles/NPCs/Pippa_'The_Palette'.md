# Pippa 'The Palette'

## Roleplaying Cues

-   **Appearance & Demeanor:** Pippa is a whirlwind of cheerful energy, perpetually adorned in colorful, practical market attire that always seems to have a stray spice or herb leaf clinging to it. Her round, expressive face is framed by a messy bun of dark, curly hair, and her eyes, though always twinkling with good humor, miss nothing. She has a habit of unconsciously rubbing her thumb and forefinger together, as if perpetually testing a texture, and often hums tuneless melodies while she works. Sheâ€™s quick with a joke or a warm greeting, but beneath the jovial exterior lies a mind sharper than a freshly honed chef's knife, constantly processing scents and murmurs.
-   **Goal:** Pippa's primary goal is to maintain her vast network of contacts and keep the flow of valuable, flavorful information moving, for a fair (and often delicious) price. She aims to be the indispensable nexus of culinary intelligence, ensuring that *true* flavor and *real* ingredients remain at the heart of the world's cuisine. She also subtly seeks opportunities to outwit NutriCorp's bland encroachments wherever possible, believing knowledge is the best seasoning against corporate control.
-   **Faction Affiliation:** **Independent Information Broker**, but with a strong lean towards the **Chef-Adventurers' Guilds**. Pippa values her neutrality, as it allows her to collect information from all corners without being overtly beholden to any. However, her deep love for authentic cuisine means she often prioritizes leads that benefit Chef-Adventurers or undermine NutriCorp's influence. She has contacts everywhere, from the Grand Gourmand Council to even disillusioned elements within the Blandlands, but her ultimate loyalty is to the preservation and discovery of flavor itself.
-   **Loves:** The vibrant chaos of a bustling market, the discovery of a truly rare ingredient, and the genuine delight on someone's face when they taste a perfect dish. She cares deeply about the diversity of culinary traditions and the passionate pursuit of flavor, seeing each unique ingredient as a story waiting to be told.
-   **Fears:** The slow, insidious creep of blandness and standardization, personified by NutriCorp's synthetic agenda. She fears a world where every meal tastes the same, where unique ingredients vanish, and where her precious network of information becomes irrelevant because there are no more secrets to be found. She also deeply fears losing her keen senses of taste and smell, her most valuable tools, which she guards with a near-superstitious reverence.

*   **Palate of Truth (Notice):** When tasting a food or drink, you gain +2 to Notice rolls to discern subtle ingredients, hidden magical properties, poisons, or its precise origin. If successful with style, you can create an Aspect on the food (e.g., "NutriCorp's Synthetic Stain" or "Traces of Umami Reef's Salt") with a free invocation.
*   **Whisper Network (Rapport):** You gain +2 to Rapport rolls when attempting to gather rumors or specific information in a crowded social setting (like a market, tavern, or even a diplomatic banquet). If you succeed with style, you not only get the information but also learn a useful piece of gossip about one of your current opponents or rivals.
*   **Market Flow (Athletics/Stealth):** Because you've spent years navigating crowded thoroughfares, you can use Athletics or Stealth instead of Provoke or Fight to create advantages or overcome obstacles when moving through a busy environment, darting through crowds, or avoiding unwanted attention.
