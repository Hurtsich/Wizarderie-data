# Chef Lyra "Aroma-Sense" Swift

## Character Guide

### Appearance & Demeanor
Lyra is a petite figure, barely past her late teens, with wide, intense eyes that seem to constantly scan her surroundings. Her dark, practical chef's coat is often smudged with flour or faint spice stains, hinting at a recent culinary endeavor. She has a habit of gently sniffing the air or subtly tasting a minute particle on her fingertip, a physical manifestation of her hyper-sensitive palate. While generally earnest and soft-spoken, a sharp, almost fiercely passionate intensity flares in her eyes when discussing the purity of ingredients or the integrity of flavor. Her youth can sometimes lead others to underestimate her, but her quiet determination is formidable.

### Personal Goal
Lyra's primary goal in this adventure is to restore the vibrant Flavorweave to Aromaville's ingredients and expose NutriCorp's insidious plot. She is driven by a deep conviction that true flavor is the essence of life and magic, and she cannot stand by while it is systematically muted. She also secretly hopes to prove her worth to the Grand Gourmand Council, showing that even a young chef can defend the world's culinary soul.

### Connections
Lyra hails from Aromaville and has dedicated her short but intense career to studying the subtle nuances of the Flavorweave within her home city's renowned ingredients. Her unique sensitivity has brought her to the attention of Master Chef Elara "Flavorheart" Vance, who recognizes Lyra's gift and has taken her under her wing as a promising protégé. Lyra feels a strong personal responsibility to protect Aromaville, a place she sees as the heart of culinary magic.

### What's Important
The unadulterated essence of natural ingredients is Lyra's most cherished ideal. She believes every ingredient has a story, a specific magical signature, and a perfect flavor waiting to be coaxed out. The thought of this purity being violated or replaced by synthetic blandness is anathema to her. She also deeply values the respect and trust of her mentor, Master Chef Elara Vance.

### What Haunts You
Lyra is profoundly haunted by the concept of "blandness." Her hyper-sensitive palate, while a gift, is also a curse; truly artificial or flavor-drained substances cause her intense physical and mental discomfort, almost like a magical allergy. She fears a future where the world becomes sterile and flavorless, a bland wasteland where her gift would become a source of perpetual suffering. The very idea of the Blandlands sends a shiver down her spine.

### Stunts
*   **Flavorweave Resonance (Notice):** Because your palate is hyper-sensitive to the Flavorweave, you gain +2 to **Notice** rolls when attempting to detect subtle magical dampening, synthetic residues, or a specific ingredient's magical signature from a distance or through barriers. You can also use Notice to Create an Advantage by sensing a powerful magical ingredient's presence (e.g., the Chef-Deity's Tooth).
*   **Palate Purge (Culinary Craft):** Once per session, when faced with an ingredient or dish tainted by synthetic blandness or Flavorweave dampening, you can spend a Fate Point to infuse a small counter-dish or an "Anti-Bland Infusion" that immediately restores a Mild consequence of blandness or dampening (e.g., 'Muted Taste', 'Dull Aroma') to a single target ingredient or dish. You can also use this to Create an Advantage representing a neutralized threat of blandness.
*   **Ingredient Insight (Gastronomic Lore):** When you successfully taste or closely examine an unknown or magically altered ingredient, you gain +2 to **Gastronomic Lore** rolls to understand its properties, origin, and any magical modifications, and you get a free invocation on an Aspect you create describing its true nature.
