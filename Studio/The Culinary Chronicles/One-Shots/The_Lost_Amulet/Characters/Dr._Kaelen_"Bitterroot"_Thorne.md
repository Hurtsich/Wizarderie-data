# Dr. Kaelen "Bitterroot" Thorne

## Character Guide

### Appearance & Demeanor

Dr. Kaelen Thorne is a man whose attire still carries the faint, crisp precision of NutriCorp's laboratories â€“ sterile, functional, and devoid of embellishment, though now perhaps a little rumpled from adventuring. He's of average height and slender build, with sharp, observant eyes often hidden behind practical spectacles. His brown hair is neatly kept, almost fastidiously so, betraying a mind that values order. Kaelen is typically quiet and reserved, preferring to observe and analyze. His movements are precise, almost clinical, and he tends to speak in measured tones, sometimes lapsing into scientific jargon. Beneath his detached exterior, a deep-seated guilt and earnest concern flicker, particularly when discussing the purity of ingredients or the dangers of synthetic foods.

### Personal Goal

Kaelen's primary goal is to atone for his past contributions to NutriCorp's synthetic food research. He is driven by a fervent desire to dismantle their Flavorweave siphon operation in Aromaville and expose their insidious plots, believing it is the only way to safeguard the world's natural flavors and the very essence of the Flavorweave. He seeks to prove that true culinary magic is superior to corporate blandness.

### Connections

Kaelen is a former NutriCorp biochemist, making him a walking repository of insider knowledge about their technologies, operational procedures, and weaknesses. This makes him an invaluable, albeit risky, ally in the fight against the corporation he once served. His conscience turned him against them, making him an enemy of his former employers and a clandestine asset to those who defend traditional cuisine.

### What's Important

Above all, Kaelen values the integrity of natural ingredients and the inherent magic of the Flavorweave. He holds a particular fondness for a rare, bio-luminescent root he once studied, known as the "Solaris Root," which he believes encapsulates the purest form of untainted Flavorweave. He believes this root holds the key to countering NutriCorp's blandness.

### What Haunts You

Kaelen is tormented by profound guilt over his role in developing synthetic enhancers and Flavorweave-dampening agents for NutriCorp. He fears that his knowledge and past actions inadvertently armed the very corporation he now fights, and that he might be too late to truly undo the damage he helped create. He also lives in constant dread of being discovered and recaptured by NutriCorp, who would undoubtedly consider him a dangerous defector.

*   **Average (+1):** Will, Rapport, Physique, Fight

### Stunts

*   **Flavorweave Signature Analysis (Investigate):** Because you understand the subtle markers of true Flavorweave and its synthetic mimics, you gain +2 to Investigate rolls when discerning between authentic and compromised ingredients, or when analyzing NutriCorp devices for their function.
*   **Subtle Siphon Disruption (Crafts):** With your precise understanding of corporate tech, once per session, when attempting to dismantle or sabotage a NutriCorp device, you can declare you have the perfect tool or knowledge, gaining +2 to your Crafts roll and creating a situation Aspect describing the device's temporary malfunction with one free invocation.
*   **Nutrient Counter-Agent (Culinary Craft):** Once per session, when working with ingredients suspected of being dulled by NutriCorp's influence, you can spend a Fate Point to infuse them with a rapidly concocted counter-agent (a specialized spice mix or extract).
