# Pre-Generated Character: Old Man Thistlewick "Iron Skillet"

## Character Guide

*   **Appearance & Demeanor:** Thistlewick is a man weathered by years spent in mountain kitchens and wild foraging expeditions. His face is a roadmap of wrinkles, framed by a wispy, often flour-dusted, grey beard. He carries a stout, well-seasoned iron skillet that seems an extension of his arm, often resting it on his hip or gesturing with it. His clothes are practical and sturdy – thick woolens and worn leather, stained with countless culinary adventures. He moves with a slow, deliberate strength, but can surprise with a sudden burst of activity. His voice is a gravelly rumble, prone to gruff pronouncements and exasperated sighs, especially when confronted with anything he deems "synthetic nonsense." He rarely smiles, but a genuine, well-prepared meal can soften his features momentarily.

*   **Personal Goal:** Thistlewick's primary goal is to preserve the sanctity of natural ingredients and ancient culinary traditions. He wants to expose NutriCorp's insidious agenda of blandness and remind the world of the true, vibrant magic of the Flavorweave. For this one-shot, his immediate objective is to ensure the "Young Sprout's Spoon" competition showcases *authentic* flavor, untainted by corporate meddling, and to teach the next generation the value of the old ways.

*   **Connections:** Thistlewick is a retired **Glacial Hearth-Keeper** from the **Frostfang Peaks**, a master of hearty, warming cuisine and traditional preservation methods. While not formally part of the Chef-Adventurers' Guilds, he is a respected (if sometimes feared) figure within traditional culinary circles, known for his uncompromising palate and staunch defense of wholesome food. He views the "Young Sprout's Spoon" competition as a crucial battleground in the ongoing war against NutriCorp, seeing the young chefs as the future of flavor. He might have a long-standing, somewhat contentious, professional relationship with Master Chef Elara "Flavorheart" Vance, rooted in shared respect for culinary integrity.

*   **What's Important:** The unadulterated essence of the Flavorweave, the purity of natural ingredients, the ancient wisdom of passed-down recipes, and the next generation of chefs who will carry on the traditions. He deeply values the simple, honest joy of a perfectly crafted, nourishing meal. His iron skillet is also profoundly important to him – a family heirloom and tool of his trade.

*   **What Haunts You:** Thistlewick is haunted by the fear of a world where all food is bland, synthetic, and devoid of the Flavorweave's magic – a silent, insidious death of culinary culture. He once witnessed the slow, unnatural decay of a sacred glacier-spring due to nearby industrial runoff (not NutriCorp directly, but a precursor), a memory that fuels his distrust of anything that compromises natural purity. He also worries he might be too set in his ways to truly adapt, or that his gruffness pushes away those he means to protect.

### Stunts

*   **Iron Skillet Defense (Kitchen Combat):** Because I've wielded my trusty iron skillet for decades, I gain +2 to Kitchen Combat rolls when defending myself or others. My skillet is stout enough to parry bladed attacks or blunt impacts.
*   **Flavorweave's Purest Essence (Culinary Craft):** Once per scene, when crafting a dish with pristine, natural ingredients, I can create a situation Aspect on the scene (e.g., "A Wave of Wholesome Aroma," "Invigorating Natural Essence") with a free invocation, representing the revitalization of the Flavorweave. This can also be used to temporarily counter minor dampening effects or purify a small batch of tainted ingredients.
*   **Ancient Hearth-Keeper's Wisdom (Gastronomic Lore):** I can use Gastronomic Lore instead of Empathy or Investigate when trying to discern the true nature or history of an ingredient, a lost recipe, or a culinary tradition, as long as it has roots in ancient practices or natural processes.
