# The Culinary Chronicles: A FATE Core Player's Guide

Welcome, Chef-Adventurer, to a world where whisk and wonder intertwine! This guide will equip you with the fundamental rules of FATE Core, tailored for your adventures in the vibrant and flavor-filled realm of The Culinary Chronicles. Prepare to explore, cook, and stand against the forces of blandness!

## 1. The Core Mechanic: Rolling Dice & Taking Actions

At the heart of FATE Core are the **Fate Dice** (also known as Fudge dice). These are special six-sided dice marked with `+`, `-`, or blank ` ` faces.

*   `+` counts as `+1`
*   `-` counts as `-1`
*   ` ` (blank) counts as `0`

When you roll Fate Dice, you always roll **four** of them. Add up the results to get a total between -4 and +4.

**Alternative using Standard Six-Sided Dice (d6):**
If you don't have Fate Dice, you can use four regular d6s:
*   `1` or `2` counts as `-1`
*   `3` or `4` counts as `0`
*   `5` or `6` counts as `+1`
Again, add up the results of your four d6s.

### The Skill Ladder

Your character's abilities are rated on a **Skill Ladder**, indicating their proficiency.
*   Legendary (+8)
*   Epic (+7)
*   Fantastic (+6)
*   Superb (+5)
*   Great (+4)
*   Good (+3)
*   Fair (+2)
*   Average (+1)
*   Mediocre (+0)
*   Terrible (-1)

### Resolving Actions

Whenever you try to do something challenging, you'll roll the dice and add your relevant skill rating. This is then compared to a **Difficulty** set by the Game Master (GM) or an **Opposed Roll** by another character.

**Formula: Roll + Skill vs. Difficulty (or Opposed Roll)**

*   **Difficulty:** The GM might say, "Preparing that mythical soufflé is a Great (+4) difficulty." You need to roll + Culinary Craft and get 4 or higher.
*   **Opposed Roll:** If you're trying to out-cook a rival, you'll roll + Culinary Craft, and they'll roll + their Culinary Craft. The higher total wins.

**Interpreting Results:**
*   **Success:** Your total equals or exceeds the difficulty/opponent's roll. You achieve your goal.
*   **Success with Style:** Your total exceeds the difficulty/opponent's roll by 3 or more. You achieve your goal, and something extra cool happens (e.g., you create a useful **Aspect** for free).
*   **Tie:** If it's an opposed roll, nothing happens, or both sides succeed with minor consequences. If against a difficulty, you usually succeed but with a minor cost or complication.
*   **Failure:** Your total is less than the difficulty/opponent's roll. You don't achieve your goal.
*   **Failure with a Cost:** The GM might offer you a way to succeed, but with a significant cost or complication. You can accept this or simply fail.

## 2. Aspects: Defining Who You Are

**Aspects** are short, evocative phrases that describe something important about a character, place, item, or situation. They are always true and can be used to influence the story.

### Types of Aspects

*   **High Concept:** Your character's core identity (e.g., "Master Chef of the Royal Kitchen," "Wandering Culinary Mercenary," "Secret Heir to a Lost Recipe").
*   **Trouble:** A core flaw, vulnerability, or recurring problem (e.g., "Addicted to Spicy Food," "Rivalry with NutriCorp," "Always Forgets the Salt").
*   **Other Character Aspects:** Specific skills, relationships, or beliefs (e.g., "Never Cooks Without My Lucky Spatula," "Fluent in Ancient Recipe Scripts," "Has a Sweet Tooth for Danger").
*   **Situation Aspects:** Temporary phrases describing the scene or something specific that just happened (e.g., "Kitchen on Fire," "Distracted by the Aroma," "Slippery Floor").
*   **Consequence Aspects:** Special aspects representing injuries or mental trauma (e.g., "Minor Burn," "Crippling Food Poisoning," "Deeply Traumatized by Blandness").

### Invoking Aspects

When an Aspect is relevant to what you're trying to do, you can **Invoke** it.
*   **To Invoke an Aspect:** Spend 1 **Fate Point**.
*   **Benefit:** Gain a +2 bonus to your roll OR re-roll all your dice.
*   **How often:** You can invoke multiple aspects on a single roll, as long as you spend a Fate Point for each. Other players can also invoke aspects on your behalf.
*   **Free Invocations:** Sometimes, you'll get a "free invocation" on an Aspect you created (e.g., by using the Create an Advantage action). These don't cost Fate Points.

### Compelling Aspects

Aspects can also make your character's life more complicated.
*   **To Compel an Aspect:** The GM (or another player, with GM approval) can suggest a complication or problem for your character based on one of their Aspects.
*   **Benefit:** If you accept the complication, you receive 1 **Fate Point**.
*   **Refusing a Compel:** If you don't want the complication to happen, you can spend 1 **Fate Point** to refuse the compel. You don't get a Fate Point for accepting a compel, and you don't lose one for refusing, you just don't gain the one for accepting.
*   **Examples:** Your "Always Forgets the Salt" Trouble aspect might be compelled to explain why your award-winning stew tastes a bit flat at the big competition.

## 3. Fate Points: Fueling the Drama

**Fate Points** are a vital resource that lets you influence the story and push your luck. You usually start each session with 3 Fate Points.

### How to Get Fate Points

*   **Accepting a Compel:** When an Aspect creates a problem for you, and you accept it.
*   **GM Award:** The GM might award Fate Points for great roleplaying or advancing the story.
*   **Having a "Trouble" Aspect:** You typically get at least one Fate Point per session for your Trouble aspect being a constant source of complications.

### How to Spend Fate Points

*   **Invoke an Aspect:** Gain a +2 bonus to a roll or re-roll your dice (see above).
*   **Power a Stunt:** Some Stunts require Fate Points to activate.
*   **Refuse a Compel:** Prevent an Aspect from causing a complication (see above).
*   **Declare a Story Detail:** Introduce a minor, plausible fact into the story (e.g., "I spend a Fate Point to say that I actually packed a small emergency spice kit in my boot"). The GM has final say on what's plausible.

## 4. Skills: Your Culinary Arsenal

Skills represent your character's learned abilities and talents. Here's a list of common skills for Chef-Adventurers, along with what they cover:

*   **Athletics:** Physical prowess, running, jumping, climbing, swimming, dodging. Useful for chasing rare ingredients or escaping angry sentient sprouts.

*   **Will:** Resisting temptations (delicious but dangerous food), focusing on a complex recipe, enduring hardship, maintaining culinary integrity against blandness.

## 5. The Four Actions: What Can You Do?

Every action you take in FATE falls into one of these four categories:

### 1. Overcome

Use Overcome when you want to **achieve a goal** or **get past an obstacle**.

*   **Examples:** Scaling a giant loaf of bread mountain (Athletics), identifying a rare ingredient (Gastronomic Lore), convincing a grumpy farmer to part with their prize-winning pumpkins (Rapport).
*   **Result:**
    *   **Success:** You achieve your goal.
    *   **Success with Style:** You achieve your goal and gain a boost or create a temporary Aspect with a free invocation.
    *   **Tie:** You achieve your goal, but with a minor cost or complication.
    *   **Failure:** You don't achieve your goal, or you achieve it at a significant cost/complication.

### 2. Create an Advantage

Use Create an Advantage to **create a new Aspect** or discover an existing one that can help you or hinder an opponent.

*   **Examples:** Distracting a guard by accidentally spilling a highly aromatic sauce ("Distracted by Aroma" Aspect), discovering the "Weak Point: Soggy Crust" on a monstrous pie, perfectly seasoning a pan to create "Non-Stick Surface" for your cooking.
*   **Result:**
    *   **Success:** You create or discover an Aspect, gaining one free invocation on it.
    *   **Success with Style:** You create or discover an Aspect, gaining two free invocations on it (or one free invocation and a Fate Point if it's a permanent Aspect like a character Aspect).
    *   **Tie:** You create or discover the Aspect, but gain no free invocations.
    *   **Failure:** You fail to create or discover the Aspect, or you might create one that helps your opponent!

### 3. Attack

Use Attack when you want to **directly harm or neutralize an opponent** in a conflict.

*   **Examples:** Striking a food critic with a rolling pin (Kitchen Combat), pelting a NutriCorp drone with magically infused hot sauce (Culinary Range), verbally dismantling a rival chef in a taste test (Provoke).
*   **Result:**
    *   **Success:** You hit your opponent and inflict stress.
    *   **Success with Style:** You hit your opponent and inflict more stress, or inflict stress and create a new Aspect on them.
    *   **Tie:** You don't inflict stress, but you don't take any either.
    *   **Failure:** You miss your opponent, or they successfully defend against your attack.

### 4. Defend

Use Defend when you want to **avoid or block an attack** or otherwise oppose another character's action.

*   **Examples:** Dodging a thrown rotten tomato (Athletics), using a cutting board to block a kitchen knife attack (Kitchen Combat), maintaining your composure against a Provoke attack (Will).
*   **Result:**
    *   **Success:** You successfully avoid or block the attack/action.
    *   **Success with Style:** You successfully avoid or block, and you gain a boost or create a temporary Aspect with a free invocation.
    *   **Tie:** The attack/action is largely avoided, but with a minor complication or cost.
    *   **Failure:** The attack/action succeeds against you.

## 6. Stunts: Your Signature Moves

**Stunts** are special abilities that let your character bend or break the rules of the game in minor ways. They represent specialized training, innate talents, or unique magical culinary techniques. You usually start with 3 stunts.

*   **Cost:** Most stunts grant a bonus to a skill in specific situations or allow you to do something unique. Some might cost a Fate Point to activate.

**Example Stunts:**

*   **Spice Cloud Mastery (Culinary Craft):** Once per session, when you succeed with style on a Culinary Craft roll to prepare a highly spiced dish, you may declare a "Choking Spice Cloud" Aspect on the scene with a free invocation, effectively blinding and distracting opponents.
*   **Ingredient Whisperer (Gastronomic Lore):** You gain +2 to Gastronomic Lore when identifying rare, magical ingredients. If you succeed with style, you also learn one unique, non-culinary application for the ingredient (e.g., "This glowing moss repels rodents," "This root glows faintly in the presence of lies").
*   **Perfect Palate (Notice):** When using Notice to discern subtle flavors, detect poisons, or identify the exact composition of a dish, you gain a free invocation on any Aspect you create about the food's hidden nature (e.g., "Subtly Poisoned," "Secret Ingredient: Dragon's Breath Chili").
*   **Swift Sauté (Kitchen Combat):** Once per conflict, after successfully defending against a physical attack, you can immediately make a Kitchen Combat attack against the aggressor, representing a quick counter-move with a pan or spatula, dealing +1 stress.

## 7. Conflict & Consequences: When Things Get Heated

Conflicts are structured scenes where characters are trying to inflict harm (physical, mental, or social) on each other.

### Stress Tracks

Your character has two **Stress Tracks** to absorb harm:
*   **Physical Stress:** For physical injuries, fatigue, or being overwhelmed.
*   **Mental Stress:** For emotional strain, doubt, fear, or mental exhaustion.

Each track typically has two boxes: [1] [2]. When you take a "hit" in a conflict, you can mark off a stress box to absorb it. Each box absorbs a specific amount of "shifts" (the amount by which an attack succeeds):
*   **[1] box:** Absorbs up to 1 shift.
*   **[2] box:** Absorbs up to 2 shifts.

You can only mark one stress box per hit. If the hit is more shifts than your marked stress box can absorb, the remaining shifts carry over.

### Consequences

If you run out of stress boxes or can't absorb all the shifts from a hit, you must take a **Consequence**. Consequences are like temporary Aspects that describe your injury or trauma. They have specific shift values and make you vulnerable.

*   **Mild Consequence:** Absorbs 2 shifts. (e.g., "Minor Burn," "Distracted by Hunger")
*   **Moderate Consequence:** Absorbs 4 shifts. (e.g., "Crippling Food Poisoning," "Loss of Confidence")
*   **Severe Consequence:** Absorbs 6 shifts. (e.g., "Shattered Tasting Bud," "Deeply Traumatized by Blandness")

You can only take one of each type of Consequence per conflict.
**Important:** Consequences are **Aspects**, which means your opponents can Invoke them against you (spending a Fate Point for +2 to a roll against you).
*   **Recovery:** Mild Consequences heal quickly (usually after the conflict), Moderate Consequences take longer (a session or two), and Severe Consequences can take many sessions or even require a specific quest to resolve.

### Taken Out

If you can't absorb a hit with stress or consequences, you are **Taken Out** of the conflict. This means you are defeated.
*   The victor decides your fate. This could mean being captured, forced to concede, losing something important, or even being banished from a culinary competition.
*   **Conceding:** You can choose to **concede** at any point before your opponent rolls to hit you. If you concede, you are Taken Out, but you get to narrate the terms of your defeat (within reason, with GM approval). You also receive 1 Fate Point for conceding, plus an additional Fate Point for each of your opponent's Aspects that were invoked against you during the conflict.

Go forth, Chef-Adventurer! Your apron is your armor, your knife your sword, and your palate the key to victory!
