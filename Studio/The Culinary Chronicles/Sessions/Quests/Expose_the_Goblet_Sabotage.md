# Quest: Expose the Goblet Sabotage

## Objective
Uncover the true perpetrators behind the sabotage of Master Chef Thyme's "Sunrise Soufflé," gather evidence to clear his name, and expose the initial plot to undermine traditional cuisine at the Goblet of Gourmand competition.

## Involved NPCs
*   **Guildmaster Saffron:** The quest-giver. She is deeply concerned about Master Chef Thyme's unjust disqualification and NutriCorp's opportunistic propaganda. She dispatches the Chef-Adventurers to investigate, providing initial guidance and expressing her strong belief in Thyme's innocence. She wants the truth revealed to protect the integrity of the Goblet and the Guild.
*   **Master Chef Thyme:** The victim. A venerable, kind-hearted chef whose reputation and legacy have been tarnished. He is currently despondent and has retreated to his private kitchen. The Chef-Adventurers must find him, speak with him gently, and gather his account of the events, which may contain crucial, overlooked details.
*   **Agent 'Synthex' Zero:** While not directly encountered in the immediate sabotage, this NutriCorp enforcer represents the organization's aggressive tactics. Elements of their operation (e.g., surveillance, misdirection, planting false evidence) are likely present. Should the Chef-Adventurers dig too deep or become too overt, they might encounter lower-level agents or even Agent 'Synthex' Zero shadowing their investigation.
*   **Pippa 'The Palette':** (Optional) If the Chef-Adventurers struggle to find leads, Pippa, a jovial information broker often found in the Spice & Savory Bazaar, might have overheard whispers or know a particular kitchen hand prone to gossiping, for a small fee or a rare ingredient.

## Success Conditions
*   **Contact Master Chef Thyme:** Successfully locate Thyme, gain his trust, and hear his full account of the incident, potentially identifying a subtle detail he missed.
*   **Investigate the Grand Kitchen Colosseum:** Discreetly examine the preparation area, Thyme's station, and the general kitchen environment for signs of tampering, unusual residues, or any evidence of "unnatural interference" as suggested by Guildmaster Saffron. Interview key kitchen staff present during the incident.
*   **Gather Conclusive Evidence:** Obtain enough tangible proof (e.g., chemical traces, witness testimonies of suspicious activity, inconsistencies in official reports, a specific device or ingredient used for sabotage) to definitively demonstrate that Thyme's soufflé was intentionally spoiled.
*   **Expose the Immediate Perpetrators/Method:** Identify *how* the sabotage was conducted and, if possible, pinpoint the individual(s) directly responsible for the act, even if they are mere pawns of NutriCorp.
*   **Clear Master Chef Thyme's Name:** Present the gathered evidence to Guildmaster Saffron, leading to the official exoneration of Master Chef Thyme.

## Failure Conditions
*   **Insufficient Evidence:** The Chef-Adventurers fail to gather enough compelling evidence to prove sabotage, leading to Master Chef Thyme's disqualification standing.
*   **Thyme's Reputation Remains Tarnished:** Thyme's name is not cleared, and he remains disgraced, potentially leading to his withdrawal from competitive cuisine.
*   **NutriCorp's Narrative Prevails:** NutriCorp's propaganda gains significant traction, further eroding public trust in traditional culinary methods and strengthening their foothold.
*   **Compromised Investigation:** The Chef-Adventurers are discovered during their discreet investigation, leading to accusations of tampering or further damaging the Guild's reputation.

## Rewards
*   **Reputation:** Increased standing with the Guild of the Whisk (+1 Guild Reputation), earning Guildmaster Saffron's full trust.
*   **Information:** Deeper understanding of NutriCorp's insidious tactics and their broader goals, hinting at the larger conspiracy.
*   **Fate Points:** 1 Fate Point awarded for successfully upholding culinary justice.
*   **Rare Ingredient:** Master Chef Thyme, once his name is cleared, may gift the Chef-Adventurers a rare, personally cultivated ingredient as a token of his gratitude (e.g., a "Whispering Thyme Leaf" which subtly enhances flavorweave potency for one dish).
*   **Spice Coins:** A modest sum of 50-100 Spice Coins from the Guild for their efforts and expenses.

## Impact on the Story
*   **Success:** Thyme's name is cleared, restoring a measure of integrity to the Goblet of Gourmand. However, the exposure of NutriCorp's sabotage confirms their malevolent intent and escalates the conflict. This event serves as a wake-up call for many Chef-Adventurers and the Grand Gourmand Council, galvanizing resistance against NutriCorp. The Chef-Adventurers are now recognized as key players in this growing struggle, leading them to investigate NutriCorp's deeper schemes and potentially exposing Dr. Aura Bland and Director Vorian Grayscale's operations. Guildmaster Saffron becomes a steadfast ally and a primary source of future quests.
*   **Failure:** Master Chef Thyme's career is irrevocably ruined, a significant blow to traditional cuisine. NutriCorp's bland narrative gains substantial ground, making future efforts to resist them much harder. The Grand Gourmand Council loses some credibility, and fear of corporate retaliation spreads among other chefs. The overall morale among Chef-Adventurers drops, and the initial phase of the "Blandness" plot progresses largely unimpeded, giving NutriCorp a significant advantage in the unfolding conflict. The Chef-Adventurers might be seen as ineffective, limiting their immediate influence and access to high-level information.
