# Quest File: Seek Out Master Chef Thyme

## Objective
Locate Master Chef Thyme in Aromaville and learn his detailed account of the sabotage that led to his disqualification from the Goblet of Gourmand competition.

## Involved NPCs
*   **Guildmaster Saffron:** The pragmatic head of the Chef-Adventurers' Guild. She dispatches the players on this quest, providing initial context and her strong belief in Thyme's innocence. She wants the Chef-Adventurers to gather information to prove Thyme's purity and expose the true orchestrators of the sabotage.
*   **Master Chef Thyme:** A venerable and kind-hearted chef, now deeply despondent and reclusive after his public humiliation. He holds the firsthand experience of the sabotage. He wants his name cleared and his legacy restored, but is too wounded to act himself, needing the Chef-Adventurers to lend an ear and investigate on his behalf.
*   **Pippa 'The Palette' (Optional):** A jovial information broker who might be found near the Spice & Savory Bazaar. If players struggle to find Thyme or want to gather local gossip beforehand, Pippa could provide directions to his secluded kitchen or mention any unusual happenings around the Bazaar, for a price (e.g., a rare ingredient, a particularly delicious pastry).

## Success Conditions
*   The Chef-Adventurers successfully locate Master Chef Thyme at his private kitchen (just west of the Spice & Savory Bazaar, behind the 'Whisk & Whiff' bakery).
*   They manage to gain his trust and gently persuade him to recount the full details of the sabotaged "Sunrise Souffl√©," including any subtle observations or odd sensations he experienced during the event that might not have made it into the official report.

## Failure Conditions
*   The Chef-Adventurers fail to locate Master Chef Thyme, either by not seeking him out or by being unable to find his reclusive kitchen.
*   They find Master Chef Thyme, but their approach is too aggressive, uncaring, or unskilled in diplomacy, causing him to retreat further into despondency and refuse to share any useful information.
*   NutriCorp agents, noticing the Chef-Adventurers' inquiries, interfere with their attempt to meet Thyme, either by intimidating him further or by leading the Chef-Adventurers astray.

## Rewards
*   **Critical Information:** Master Chef Thyme's detailed firsthand account of the sabotage, which includes:
    *   Specifics of the "inert Flavorweave activator" (magical yeast) and the "metallic taint" in the eggs.
    *   His insistence that the ingredients were pristine when he started.
    *   Potentially a subtle detail he noticed: a fleeting, unusual aroma in the air near his station, a strange residue on a discarded utensil, or a brief, almost imperceptible flicker in the Flavorweave around his dish just before it collapsed.
*   **Reputation:** Increased standing with Guildmaster Saffron and the Guild of the Whisk, marking the Chef-Adventurers as trustworthy and effective.
*   **Item (Optional):** If the players successfully uplift Thyme's spirits, he might offer a sample of the 'inert' magical yeast or a perfectly preserved, small batch of his special aged truffle oil as a token of gratitude and hope.
*   **Fate Points (GM Discretion):** Awarded for excellent roleplaying in comforting/persuading Thyme.

## Impact on the Story
*   **Unlocks Further Investigation:** Thyme's account serves as the foundational lead for the next stage of the quest. The specific details he provides (e.g., strange aroma, residue, ingredient behavior) will direct the Chef-Adventurers' focus when they investigate the Grand Kitchen Colosseum, turning a general inquiry into a targeted search for specific clues.
*   **Deepens the Conspiracy:** Thyme's insistence that the ingredients were initially fine, coupled with the official report's findings, highlights the sophisticated nature of the sabotage, suggesting a method that goes beyond simple ingredient tampering and points directly towards a more insidious, possibly magical, interference by NutriCorp's "Flavor Abatement Division."
*   **Emotional Stakes Increased:** Witnessing Thyme's devastation solidifies the Chef-Adventurers' understanding of the human cost of NutriCorp's actions, strengthening their resolve to fight against the encroachment of blandness and uphold culinary integrity.
*   **Potential Allyship:** A successful interaction with Thyme can forge a valuable connection. He could become a source of future culinary wisdom, rare ingredient leads, or even practical support in later stages of the adventure.
*   **Propaganda Advantage (Failure):** If the players fail, Thyme's story remains unheard, and NutriCorp's narrative of the unreliability of traditional cuisine gains further traction, making the fight to restore flavor more difficult and potentially emboldening their operations.
