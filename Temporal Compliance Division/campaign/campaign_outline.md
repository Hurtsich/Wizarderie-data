# Temporal Compliance Division: The Series of Minor Setbacks Campaign

## Theme and Tone
- **Theme:** Navigating bureaucratic absurdity and malfunctioning technology while performing low-stakes temporal cleanup.
- **Tone:** Comedic, bureaucratic-dystopian, satirical, with moments of genuine tension and workplace camaraderie. Think 'Men in Black' meets 'The Office' meets 'Brazil' on a shoestring budget.
- **Central Conflict:** The struggle of Sector 7G agents (the Compliance Crew) to effectively perform their minor temporal correction duties amidst crippling bureaucracy, constant equipment failure, interdepartmental rivalries (especially with the Red Tape Brigade), budget cuts enforced by Chrono-Auditors, and the looming threat of audits, while potentially uncovering signs of deeper issues within the TCD (Paradox Purists, The Glitch Incident fallout, Agent Veritas's Disappearance) or the Timestream itself.
- **Target Audience:** Players who enjoy humor, problem-solving, character interaction, navigating social/bureaucratic challenges, and stories where low stakes are treated with comical seriousness.
- **Playstyle:** Emphasis on investigation, social maneuvering, creative problem-solving with limited resources (faulty equipment), and roleplaying workplace dynamics. Combat is rare and usually involves malfunctioning equipment, minor temporal phenomena, or non-lethal containment rather than direct confrontation.

## Overview
Players are agents in Sector 7G, the perpetually underfunded and overlooked department of the Temporal Compliance Division based at Chronos HQ. They undertake 'Temporal Hygiene Adjustments' to fix minor anachronisms (e.g., removing a Segway from the Siege of Troy, correcting a misplaced latte in Renaissance Florence during missions to locations like Epoch City). Their primary antagonists are often not paradoxes, but malfunctioning gear procured via Paradox Plaza or scavenged from Continuum Caves, arcane regulations enforced by the Red Tape Brigade, and the ever-watchful Chrono-Auditors. Over time, seemingly isolated minor incidents might hint at larger patterns, the activities of the shadowy Paradox Purists, internal conspiracies involving the Upper Echelon, or the legacy of past TCD failures like 'The Glitch Incident' or 'Agent Veritas's Disappearance'. Success is measured less by heroic deeds and more by correctly filed paperwork (avoiding the wrath of a Red Tape Bureaucrat), meeting quotas set by the Sector 7G Supervisor, and avoiding disciplinary action or mandatory re-training seminars.

## Main Arcs
- Probationary Paradoxes: Learning the ropes and the absurdity of the TCD.
- Anomalous Audits: Uncovering strange patterns and attracting unwanted attention from Auditors and Purists.
- Compliance Optional: Confronting the core conspiracy/threat and making difficult choices about loyalty and action.

## Progression Path
Players advance primarily through narrative milestones: completing missions (gaining minimal XP/Reputation), successfully navigating bureaucratic challenges (gaining Contacts/Favors/Loopholes), uncovering major secrets (gaining Clues/Leverage), acquiring better (often unofficial or experimental) gear, and building relationships (positive or negative) with key NPCs and factions. Skill progression might be slow, emphasizing clever use of existing abilities and resources.

## Difficulty Curve
Starts low with mundane tasks (paperwork, simple anomaly retrieval) and bureaucratic hurdles. Ramps up significantly in Arc 2 as anomalies become patterned, Chrono-Auditors apply pressure, and Paradox Purists begin direct interference. Peaks in Arc 3 with high stakes, dangerous confrontations, complex moral choices, and potentially timeline-threatening events.

## Multiple Paths
- Bureaucratic Ascent: Focus on mastering the TCD's rules and politics to rise within the system (very difficult, likely involves compromises).
- Covert Investigation: Focus on uncovering conspiracies (Purists, Veritas, Glitch Incident) while maintaining a low profile.
- Resourceful Independence: Focus on building alliances with unofficial groups (Temporal Tinkers Guild) and operating outside the TCD system as much as possible.
- Direct Action: Focus on actively confronting threats (Purists, corrupt officials) often requiring bending or breaking rules.
- Veritas Legacy: Following the trail of Agent Veritas, adopting their methods or goals.
- Sector 7G Loyalists: Prioritizing the survival and well-being of the Sector 7G team above all else.

## Easter Eggs
- Finding a vintage 'flux capacitor' schematic in the Anomaly Archive, marked 'Theoretically Unsound'.
- A mission to retrieve a strangely familiar blue police box from 1960s London.
- Encountering graffiti that says 'Agent Veritas Lives' or 'The Glitch Incident Was An Inside Job'.
- A vending machine in Paradox Plaza that sells items moments *after* you realize you needed them.
- A mission report mentioning cleanup of 'temporal residue consistent with DeLorean tire tracks' near a high school.
- Hearing muzak version of a famous Sci-Fi theme in the Chronos HQ elevators.
- Finding a stapler embedded in temporal gelatin in the Sector 7G office.

## Campaign Hooks
### Mandatory Assignment / Conscription
**Personal Motivation:** Just transferred (or conscripted due to a clerical error) into Sector 7G. Need to learn the ropes quickly and survive this bureaucratic nightmare without losing sanity.
**Group Motivation:** Assigned as a new Compliance Crew team to handle Sector 7G's overflowing backlog of minor incidents. Sink or swim together under the Sector 7G Supervisor's watchful eye.

**Potential Developments:**

- Exploring the hazardous Continuum Caves for salvageable tech, rare temporal materials, or lost TCD equipment, encountering environmental hazards or strange creatures.
- Participating in the (highly unofficial and technically forbidden) TCD Fantasy Anomaly League, betting on mission outcomes and anomaly types.
- Helping Temporal Tinkers Guild members with personal side projects (often involving dangerous or unstable temporal tech) in exchange for favors or gear.
- Investigating urban legends of Chronos HQ, such as the haunted Sector that doesn't officially exist, the location of the Perpetual Motion Memo, or the janitor who knows too much.
- Missions to bizarre non-humanoid temporal locations like the crystalline structures of Aeon Citadel or the shifting landscapes of the Temporal Rift Valley.
- Dealing with inter-agent rivalries or pranks within Sector 7G.

## Narrative Structure
Episodic Mission-Based Structure Driving Overarching Arcs.

### Details
The campaign progresses through individual 'Temporal Hygiene Adjustment' missions (episodes), typically bookended by bureaucratic tasks and office life at Chronos HQ. These seemingly isolated missions provide clues, resources, and character interactions that feed into the three main story arcs (Probationary Paradoxes, Anomalous Audits, Compliance Optional), gradually revealing the larger conspiracy/threat and escalating the stakes.

### Impact
Allows for varied gameplay sessions (investigation, social, problem-solving, occasional hazard) while building a cohesive larger narrative. Success/failure in episodes directly impacts resources, reputation, NPC attitudes, and available leads for the main arcs.

### Player Interaction
Players choose which leads or rumors to follow, how to approach mission objectives (stealth, technical, social, brute force - rarely effective), and how to navigate TCD politics and regulations. These choices directly influence the direction and outcome of the arcs.

### Development Potential
Modular structure allows the GM to easily insert side quests, respond to player interests by expanding certain mission types or NPC interactions, and adjust the pacing of the main arcs.

## Character Development
Focus on Skill Application, Reputation Management, and Moral/Bureaucratic Navigation.

### Details
Character development is less about traditional power gain and more about adapting to the TCD environment. Characters grow by learning to apply their skills creatively with limited resources, building relationships (allies/rivals/contacts), acquiring favors, mastering bureaucratic loopholes (or learning how to forge forms convincingly), and making choices that shape their reputation (reliable, reckless, efficient, rule-bender) and potentially compromise their initial ideals.

### Impact
Character growth feels earned and is directly tied to navigating the campaign's specific challenges (bureaucracy, faulty tech, ethical dilemmas). Success often means becoming better at manipulating the system or operating outside it, rather than becoming generically 'stronger'.

### Player Interaction
Players' choices in dealing with NPCs (Supervisor, Auditors, Guild, Bureaucrats), factions, mission objectives, and adherence (or lack thereof) to regulations shape their character's reputation, available opportunities, and internal struggles (cynicism vs. idealism).

### Development Potential
Allows for significant roleplaying arcs centered on themes like disillusionment, rebellion, finding camaraderie in adversity, upholding principles vs. achieving results, and the slow descent into becoming part of the bureaucratic machine.

## World Interaction
Emphasis on Bureaucracy as Environment, Social Maneuvering, and Environmental Problem-Solving with Faulty Tech.

### Details
Interacting with the world of the TCD fundamentally involves dealing with forms, regulations, uncooperative NPCs embodying bureaucratic archetypes (Red Tape Bureaucrat, jaded Supervisor), and constantly malfunctioning technology. Players need to use wits, social skills (persuasion, intimidation, bribery, gossip), technical ingenuity (jury-rigging, scavenging), and creative application of limited temporal gadgets to overcome obstacles that are often systemic rather than physical.

### Impact
The environment itself – both the physical locations (Chronos HQ, mission sites) and the intangible bureaucratic system – often functions as an antagonist or a complex puzzle to be solved.

### Player Interaction
Players are encouraged to find unconventional solutions, exploit system weaknesses (faulty tech, loopholes in regulations, NPC motivations), interact extensively with the social/political landscape of the TCD, and treat paperwork as a potential weapon or shield.

### Development Potential
The world reacts (often slowly and inefficiently, true to its nature) to player actions. Gaining a reputation, breaking rules, or fixing problems can open or close avenues, trigger audits, or change NPC attitudes, making the TCD feel like a living (if dysfunctional) entity.

## Player Agency
High Agency within Mission Execution, Investigation Paths, and Arc Direction Choices.

### Details
While missions are often assigned by the Sector 7G Supervisor, players typically have significant freedom in *how* they accomplish the objectives (stealth, social engineering, technical skill, creative use of malfunctioning gear, bending/breaking rules). Their cumulative choices regarding which leads to pursue, which mysteries to investigate, which factions to trust or oppose, and how to handle critical ethical/regulatory dilemmas determine which secrets are uncovered and how the main story arcs unfold.

### Impact
Player decisions directly shape their experience, relationships with key NPCs, access to resources, the specific challenges they face, and the ultimate outcome of the campaign. The story adapts to their focus.

### Player Interaction
Key decisions involve choosing investigation paths (focus on Purists vs. Veritas vs. internal issues), deciding team tactics for missions, managing relationships with TCD factions, allocating scarce resources (favors, working gear), and making critical choices during plot twists and arc climaxes.

### Development Potential
Multiple branching paths and alternative endings are designed based on anticipated major player choices, allowing the campaign to diverge significantly based on the group's actions and priorities.

## Pacing and Rhythm
Alternating Mundane Bureaucracy and Office Politics with Brief, Intense Moments of Temporal Weirdness, Tension, and Comedic Failure.

### Details
The typical gameplay loop involves: Briefing (often confusing) -> Bureaucratic Hurdle (requisitions, forms, permissions) -> Mission Deployment (via unreliable temporal transport) -> Mission Execution (problem-solving temporal anomaly with faulty gear, potential minor hazards/weirdness) -> Debriefing/Paperwork -> Office Politics/Rumors/Downtime Activities (gear maintenance, dealing with Supervisor/Auditors). Pacing naturally accelerates within arcs as stakes rise, investigations yield results, and threats become more direct, leading to less downtime and more urgency.

### Impact
Creates a distinct comedic and sometimes tense rhythm contrasting the soul-crushing drudgery of TCD office life with the inherent absurdity and occasional danger of low-stakes time travel. Tension builds gradually towards arc climaxes, punctuated by moments of bureaucratic frustration or sudden equipment failure.

### Player Interaction
Players influence pacing by how efficiently (or inefficiently) they complete tasks, which side activities or investigations they pursue during downtime, how they choose to escalate or de-escalate situations with NPCs/factions, and how quickly they follow major plot leads.

### Development Potential
Allows the GM to adjust pacing easily by introducing sudden audits, urgent 'priority' missions (that are still mundane), mandatory 'team-building' exercises, equipment breakdowns, or new bureaucratic directives from the Red Tape Brigade or Upper Echelon.

## Emotional Journey
From Confusion and Bureaucratic Frustration to Dark Humor, Camaraderie, Cynicism, and potentially Unlikely Heroism or Principled Rebellion.

### Details
Players likely begin feeling overwhelmed, confused, and frustrated by the TCD's inefficiency and absurdity. This often evolves into a shared dark humor and strong sense of camaraderie with their fellow Compliance Crew members facing the same struggles. Depending on choices and discoveries, this foundation can lead characters down paths of cynical survivalism (just doing the job, keeping head down), determined investigation (seeking truth despite obstacles), pragmatic reformism (trying to fix the system from within), or outright rebellion against perceived injustices, corruption, or existential threats.

### Impact
Aims for a blend of satirical comedy derived from workplace absurdity and bureaucratic horror, moments of genuine tension during missions or confrontations, satisfying problem-solving, and potentially poignant choices with real moral weight.

### Player Interaction
Roleplaying responses to the daily grind of bureaucracy, mission failures/successes, equipment malfunctions, NPC interactions (especially the Supervisor and Auditors), ethical dilemmas, and the discovery of deeper secrets drives the emotional arc of the characters and the group.

### Development Potential
Characters can end the campaign as jaded but surviving veterans content with their lot, unlikely reformers who made a small difference, despised whistleblowers or celebrated heroes, cynical agents who escaped the system, or even the new, equally overwhelmed management, depending on their choices and the campaign's outcome.

## Key Moments
### The team's essential temporal gadgetry (scanner, stabilizer, containment unit) fails catastrophically at a critical moment during an early mission, forcing desperate improvisation and highlighting the campaign's core challenge.
**Impact:** Establishes the unreliable nature of TCD tech, the theme of resourcefulness, and the comedic/tense tone.
### The unannounced arrival of the meticulous Lead Chrono-Auditor forces the players to scramble, hide evidence of rule-bending/unofficial gear, justify their actions (and existence), and endure intense scrutiny.
**Impact:** Introduces a major recurring antagonist force, highlights the pressure of TCD bureaucracy, and potentially reveals the Auditor's hidden agenda.
### The dawning realization (through data analysis, found objects, or sabotage) that seemingly random minor anomalies are connected, hinting at the Paradox Purists, Veritas, or a deeper TCD issue.
**Impact:** Shifts the campaign focus from purely episodic missions towards investigating the central mystery/conspiracy.
### A situation where following direct TCD orders/protocol clearly conflicts with preventing harm, uncovering a critical truth, or stopping the antagonist's plan, forcing a conscious decision to break ranks.
**Impact:** Represents a point of no return, forcing a major decision about loyalty, morality, and risk, with significant consequences for reputation and plot direction.
### The final encounter with the primary antagonist (Purist Leader, rogue AI, Agent Veritas, corrupt Upper Echelon figure) and the resolution of the central conflict at a key location.
**Impact:** Climax of the campaign, resolving the main threat based on player choices, skills, and accumulated resources/allies.

## Critical Choices
### How heavily do the players depend on the unofficial (and illegal) services of the Temporal Tinkers Guild in Paradox Plaza for gear repairs, upgrades, and bypassing regulations?
**Impact:** Not specified
### When first encountering concrete evidence of sabotage or Purist activity, do players report it officially through TCD channels or investigate secretly?
**Impact:** Not specified
### If the Lead Chrono-Auditor reveals (or hints at) their own investigation into deeper issues (Plot Twist), do the players cooperate, antagonize, or try to expose them?
**Impact:** Not specified
### If players uncover Veritas's hidden cache, final message, or encounter Veritas directly, what do they do with the potentially damaging information about the TCD, or how do they react to Veritas's true nature/goals?
**Impact:** Not specified
### How do the players approach the final antagonist and the resolution of the main threat during the campaign climax?
**Impact:** Not specified

## Hidden Secrets
### Sector 7G isn't just underfunded due to incompetence; it's deliberately designed by the Upper Echelon/AI as a 'canary in the coal mine' for unstable temporal phenomena, a testing ground for faulty tech prototypes, or a dumping ground for problematic agents under subtle observation.
**Impact:** Not specified
### Evidence exists (in obscure Anomaly Archive records, deep Continuum Caves artifacts, or specific Era Ruins) of other temporal agencies or factions that the TCD competed with and possibly violently eliminated in the past. The TCD might not be the only (or even the first) major temporal power.
**Impact:** Not specified
### The Timestream Cafeteria's infamous, universally despised food isn't just synthetic nutrient paste. It's processed from recycled temporal paradoxes, leftover organic matter from corrected timelines, or failed temporal experiments. 'Soylent Green is Paradoxes!'
**Impact:** Not specified
### The urban legend is true. The memo (and the cabinet it's filed in) actually exists, buried deep within Chronos HQ's decommissioned administrative levels (possibly near old Sector 7G offices), guarded by layers of bureaucratic traps, temporal loops, and possibly a very persistent filing clerk automaton.
**Impact:** Not specified
### The Sector 7G Supervisor isn't just a jaded bureaucrat. They might have connections to Agent Veritas, suspicions about the Upper Echelon/AI, or know the real reason for 7G's status, but are too afraid or broken by the system to act directly.
**Impact:** Not specified

## Alternative Endings
### Players successfully neutralize the main threat (Purists, rogue AI, etc.) and manage to expose corruption or critical flaws, leading to tangible (if minor) reforms within the TCD. Sector 7G gets a slight budget increase, maybe even new chairs, and the players are grudgingly promoted to slightly less terrible jobs within TCD.
**Impact:** Not specified
### In stopping the main threat, the players' actions lead to the dismantling or collapse of the TCD structure (or key parts of it). They might become fugitives hunted by remnants, heroes trying to build something new from the ashes, or simply lost amidst the temporal chaos they unleashed.
**Impact:** Not specified
### Seeing the TCD as irredeemably flawed, corrupt, or dangerous, the players use the chaos of the climax to fake their deaths, steal a (hopefully) reliable temporal device, and escape into the vast Timestream, finally free from bureaucracy, audits, and Chrono-loaf.
**Impact:** Not specified
### Through a bizarre combination of competence, manipulation, sheer luck, or everyone else being incapacitated, the player characters end up in charge of Sector 7G (or, in a highly unlikely comedic twist, gain significant influence over the entire TCD). They now face the same bureaucratic nightmares, budget cuts, and faulty equipment, but from the other side of the desk.
**Impact:** Not specified
### Players successfully stop the immediate threat (Purists contained, rogue tech disabled) but fail to address or expose the underlying systemic issues within the TCD (corruption, AI control, Glitch Incident fallout). Things essentially return to 'normal' – Sector 7G remains underfunded, bureaucratic, and absurd, but maybe slightly safer for now. They receive an official commendation memo (likely with typos and filed incorrectly).
**Impact:** Not specified

## Campaign Sections
## Arc 1: Probationary Paradoxes
Introduction to the TCD, the soul-crushing reality of Sector 7G, the core mechanics of minor temporal cleanup ('anomaly retrieval'), and the overwhelming weight of bureaucracy headquartered at Chronos HQ. Focuses on basic missions, learning the ropes (and loopholes), meeting key personalities like the Sector 7G Supervisor and the first Red Tape Bureaucrat encounters, understanding resource scarcity, and the necessity of dealing with the Temporal Tinkers Guild via Paradox Plaza.

**Difficulty Level:** Low
**Estimated Duration:** 3-5 sessions

### Key Events
- First Day Orientation: Introduction to TCD rules, Sector 7G's 'unique' status, and immediate equipment malfunction during temporal familiarization.

- Antagonizing key bureaucratic figures like the Red Tape Brigade, leading to insurmountable obstacles.
- Being caught violating major regulations by Chrono-Auditors during probation.
- Causing a noticeable (though still minor) temporal paradox that requires another team to clean up.
## Arc 2: Anomalous Audits
The minor anomalies the Compliance Crew deals with start exhibiting strange connections or patterns, hinting at something more coordinated than random temporal hiccups. Simultaneously, the Chrono-Auditors, led by the meticulous Lead Chrono-Auditor, become more active, possibly targeting Sector 7G due to perceived incompetence, rumors of regulation bending, or the emerging anomaly pattern itself. Players uncover hints about the Paradox Purists' activities or the enduring mystery surrounding Agent Veritas's disappearance.

**Difficulty Level:** Medium
**Estimated Duration:** 4-6 sessions

### Key Events
- Pattern Recognition: A series of seemingly unrelated anomalies across different Epoch Cities or Era Ruins display a common temporal signature or recurring motif.
- Surprise Audit: Sector 7G is subjected to a rigorous, unannounced audit by the Lead Chrono-Auditor and their team, scrutinizing mission logs, equipment, and personnel.
- Veritas's Echo: Players discover a hidden message, encrypted file, or uniquely modified artifact potentially left behind by Agent Veritas.
- Purist Interference: First direct (though possibly subtle or deniable) interference from Paradox Purists during a mission – sabotage, misdirection, or temporal traps.
- Archive Heist: Need to secure restricted information, technology blueprints, or an artifact from the heavily regulated Anomaly Archive or dangerous depths of the Continuum Caves.
- Supervisor Under Pressure: The Sector 7G Supervisor becomes increasingly stressed due to the audits and anomaly patterns, potentially acting erratically or seeking the players' help unofficially.

### Player Hooks
- The Investigator / Pattern Seeker

### Mysteries
- What is the pattern connecting the recent anomalies, and what does it signify?
- Who tipped off the Chrono-Auditors about Sector 7G's specific infractions, or why is the audit so intense?

### Plot Twists
- The Lead Chrono-Auditor isn't just enforcing rules out of spite; they are secretly investigating the same pattern the players are, suspecting high-level corruption or a cover-up related to 'The Glitch Incident' or the Purists.

### Story Beats
- Retrieving a critical piece of information (e.g., Veritas's research file, Purist communication intercept) from the heavily regulated Anomaly Archive.
- A routine mission (e.g., stabilizing a minor Temporal Rift Valley fluctuation) goes wrong due to direct Paradox Purist interference (e.g., equipment sabotage, temporal trap, direct but brief confrontation).

### Required Resources
- Improved (but still potentially glitchy) gear, possibly sourced via Temporal Tinkers Guild.
- Accumulated favors, contacts, or blackmail material.
- Security clearance (possibly needing temporary upgrades via illicit means).

- The Veritas Obsession: Prioritizing finding Agent Veritas's Cache or uncovering their fate.
- Internal Affairs: Focusing on navigating TCD politics, exposing the informant, and protecting Sector 7G.
- Maintain Low Profile: Trying to fulfill duties while avoiding the major conflicts (increasingly difficult).

### Success Conditions
- Successfully navigate the audit without Sector 7G being shut down or severely crippled.
- Identify the source or nature of the anomaly pattern (likely pointing to Purists or TCD internal issue).
- Gain significant leads on the Paradox Purists' goals/methods or Agent Veritas's fate/legacy.
- Survive encounters with Purist interference.

- The Lead Chrono-Auditor becoming an implacable foe.
## Arc 3: Compliance Optional
The full scope of the conspiracy (Paradox Purists, internal TCD corruption linked to The Glitch Incident, or Agent Veritas's true agenda) becomes clear. The Compliance Crew must make critical decisions about where their loyalties lie – with the flawed TCD system represented by Chronos HQ, with their Sector 7G colleagues and Supervisor, or with a potentially 'greater good' that necessitates violating regulations and possibly going rogue. The climax involves confronting the source of the temporal threat or corruption, with potentially timeline-altering stakes (at least locally).

**Difficulty Level:** High
**Estimated Duration:** 5-7 sessions

### Key Events
- Veritas's Revelation: Discovery of Agent Veritas's Hidden Cache, final message, or direct encounter, revealing their true fate, motives, or warnings.
- Purist Endgame Revealed: Uncovering the Paradox Purists' ultimate goal (e.g., weaponizing paradoxes, erasing the TCD, 'purifying' the timeline) and identifying their leader.
- The Glitch Incident Connection: Uncovering a major secret connecting 'The Glitch Incident' to the current threat, potentially revealing a TCD cover-up or a recurring temporal instability.
- Point of No Return: A critical decision forces players to overtly choose between following direct orders from the Upper Echelon/TCD command and taking unsanctioned action they believe is necessary.
- Climactic Confrontation: A final mission to prevent a major temporal disruption (potentially caused by Purists, malfunctioning TCD super-tech from the Glitch Incident era, or Veritas) or expose high-level corruption within the TCD, likely taking place in a critical location like the heart of Chronos HQ, deep within the Temporal Rift Valley, or specific Era Ruins.
- Sector 7G's Stand: Sector 7G itself might become a battleground or strategic location, forcing players to defend their home turf or use its obscurity to their advantage.

### Player Hooks
- The Whistleblower / Rebel / Reformer

### Mysteries
- What is the Paradox Purists' ultimate goal, who leads them, and what is their origin?
- What *really* happened during 'The Glitch Incident'? How is it related to the current threat, Agent Veritas, and the TCD's secrets?

### Plot Twists
- The 'Upper Echelon' isn't incompetent human bureaucrats, but a sophisticated, possibly damaged or erratic, AI (perhaps developed after The Glitch Incident) trying to maintain temporal stability via complex, cold logic and counter-intuitive regulations. It views human agents as unreliable variables.
- Agent Veritas wasn't lost or killed; they orchestrated their disappearance to investigate the TCD/Glitch Incident freely. They might now be a rogue agent fighting both TCD and Purists, the secret leader/founder of the Paradox Purists (believing extreme measures are needed), or trying to guide the players to the truth from the shadows.

### Story Beats
- The 'All Hands' Emergency Meeting / TCD Alert
- Final Confrontation at the Source (e.g., Purist Base in Era Ruins, Chronos HQ Core, Temporal Rift Valley focal point)

### Required Resources
- Agent Veritas's Cache (potentially providing key info/tech).
- Support from allied factions (Temporal Tinkers Guild, reformed Chrono-Auditors, loyal Sector 7G agents).
- High-risk experimental tech (possibly unstable).
- Leverage/blackmail material against TCD factions or individuals.
- Deep understanding of temporal mechanics and TCD's flaws.

### Optional Content
- Attempting to find and utilize the legendary Perpetual Motion Memo for unlimited power (likely a wild goose chase or trap).
- Exploring the deepest, most dangerous levels of the Continuum Caves for lost super-tech or answers.
- Visiting the Era Ruins of a timeline destroyed by a similar threat for clues or warnings.
- Trying to get the Timestream Cafeteria to cater the final confrontation.

### Branching Paths
- The Reformist Path: Side with TCD elements (Auditor?) seeking reform from within.
- The Veritas Path: Ally with Agent Veritas (if their goals align or seem justifiable).
- The Scorched Earth Path: Aim to destroy the threat and expose/dismantle TCD corruption, regardless of consequences.
- The Escape Path: Use the chaos to escape the TCD entirely.
- The Accidental Leadership Path: Somehow end up in charge of Sector 7G or more.

### Success Conditions
- Neutralize the primary threat (Paradox Purists, internal corruption, legacy tech/AI, Veritas's plan).
- Survive the fallout of the confrontation and its consequences.
- Achieve the players' chosen objective (reform TCD, escape, expose truth, etc.).
- Ensure Sector 7G's survival (or orchestrate its honorable/necessary end).

### Failure Conditions
- A major temporal catastrophe is unleashed (timeline altered drastically, paradox cascade).
- The TCD is destroyed, becomes irrevocably tyrannical, or falls under control of the antagonist.
- Player characters are killed, captured permanently, or irrevocably lost in the Timestream.
- The primary threat successfully executes its plan.
- Chrono-loaf quality somehow gets even worse.
