# "Mr. Jones" - Temporal Broker / Information Dealer

## Role
Minor NPC / Potential recurring contact. Represents the Chronosynclastic Syndicate or similar illicit temporal operations. Deals in forbidden artifacts, paradox tech, or sensitive information - for a price.

## Physical Description
Appearance shifts subtly, often nondescript. Prefers dimly lit corners of temporal crossroads or neutral zones. Might appear as a man in a slightly-too-old suit one meeting, a woman in futuristic chrome the next. The only constant is watchful eyes and an unnerving calm.

- **Relationships:**
  - Players (MIU Agents): Potential Customers/Marks/Enemies; views them based on utility.
  - Chronosynclastic Syndicate: Agent/Associate/Freelancer; exact status unclear.
  - TCD: Obstacle/Source of Business (exploiting their failures).
  - Eldrin Thorne: Possible past connection? Rumors link Syndicate origins to Thorne.

## Motivations

## Development Potential
Can be a dangerous source of information, forbidden technology, or mission objectives outside TCD channels. Dealing with 'Mr. Jones' is risky and attracts TID attention. Could become a recurring contact, antagonist, or even unreliable ally depending on player choices and campaign direction. Might hold clues to deeper conspiracies.

## Reaction to Players
Treats them cautiously and transactionally. Interested only in what they can offer (information, credits, access) or what can be exploited. Will likely test their discretion and competence. Provides reliable service if paid, but will not hesitate to betray them if advantageous or necessary for self-preservation.
