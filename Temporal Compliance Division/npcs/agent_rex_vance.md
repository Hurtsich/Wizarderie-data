# Agent Rex Vance - Field Agent, Major Events Division (MED)

## Role
Recurring NPC/Rival. Embodies the arrogance and better funding of MED. Looks down on MIU agents. May occasionally interfere with MIU missions (accidentally or intentionally) or compete for resources/recognition. Mallory's cousin.

## Physical Description
Mid-30s, smug grin often playing on his lips. Wears slightly customized, higher-quality TCD gear. Carries himself with unearned confidence. Well-groomed, perhaps spends agency time polishing his temporal manipulator. Enjoys leaning casually against walls during conversations with MIU staff.

## Background

- **Significant Events:**

  - Known for taking credit for team successes.
  - Avoided blame for minor errors by shifting it elsewhere.
- **Relationships:**
  - Players (MIU Agents): Dismissive/Condescending; sees them as janitors of the timeline.
  - Supervisor Mallory Vance: Embarrassing Cousin; enjoys reminding her of MIU's lower status.
  - Agent Silas Sterling (TID): Cautious Avoidance; knows TID can target anyone, even MED 'stars'.
  - MED Colleagues: Competitive/Networking; constantly trying to climb the MED ladder.
- **Secrets:**
  - Possibly cut corners on a past MED mission, covered it up.
  - Secretly insecure about his actual competence compared to MED veterans.
  - May be exaggerating his accomplishments.

## Motivations

## Development Potential
Primarily serves as an antagonist/foil representing interdepartmental rivalry. Could potentially be humbled by events, forced to cooperate with MIU, or even become a source of information if his own position is threatened. His arrogance might lead him into trouble the players can exploit or resolve.

## Reaction to Players
Condescending and dismissive. Will likely mock their equipment and assignments. Might interfere if mission areas overlap, prioritizing his own objectives. Could be manipulated by appealing to his ego or desire for glory, but is generally untrustworthy.
