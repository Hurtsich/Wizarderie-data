# Agent Silas Sterling - Investigator, Temporal Integrity Department (TID)

## Role
Major NPC/Antagonist/Potential Ally. Represents the ever-present threat of internal affairs. Cold, calculating, and devoted to TCD protocol. Investigates irregularities, agent misconduct, and paradox contamination. May be related to Quinn Sterling.

## Physical Description
Early 30s, sharp, impeccable appearance. Always in a perfectly pressed regulation suit. Moves with quiet precision. Eyes are observant and miss little. Face rarely shows emotion, maintaining a neutral, professional mask. Carries an air of quiet authority and judgment.

## Background
- **Origin:** Possibly from a family with TCD history (Sterling name connection?). Excelled in TCD academy, specifically chosen for TID due to meticulous nature and unwavering belief in regulations.
- **Significant Events:**
  - Involved in the investigation following 'The Stapler Incident'
  - Handled several high-profile (internal) agent misconduct cases
  - Known for thoroughness and incorruptibility (or perceived lack of empathy)
  - Consistently receives high performance reviews
- **Relationships:**
  - Players (MIU Agents): Subjects of potential investigation; views them with professional suspicion.
  - Supervisor Mallory Vance: Scrutiny; aware of her anxiety and potential weaknesses.
  - Agent Rex Vance (MED): Professional distance; likely views MED arrogance as a potential compliance risk.
  - Quinn Sterling (Tech Specialist): Possible estranged sibling/relative; interactions are cold and formal, hinting at unspoken history.
  - TID Leadership: Loyal Subordinate; dedicated to TID's mission.
  - Chronosynclastic Syndicate: Primary Target; sees them as the ultimate violation of temporal integrity.
- **Secrets:**
  - May harbor secret doubts about certain TCD protocols but believes the system is paramount.
  - Potentially covering for a past mistake made by himself or a superior.
  - The nature of his relationship with Quinn Sterling is hidden.
  - Might be aware of deeper conspiracies (like Oversight Committee issues) but focuses only on protocol violations.
  - Could be secretly searching for the 'Anomaly Clock' for TID.

  - Judgmental
  - Unemotional
  - Observant
  - Dedicated
  - Intimidating

  - Procedure
  - Integrity (as defined by TCD rules)

  - The Timeline's Stability
- **Fears:**

- **Desires:**
  - Perfect compliance throughout TCD
  - Exposure of all rule-breakers
  - Maintaining timeline stability through strict enforcement

## Motivations
- Uphold TCD regulations without exception.
- Investigate any hint of temporal contamination or agent error.
- Root out inefficiency and corruption.
- Ensure the timeline remains stable by punishing deviations.

## Goals
- Successfully close investigations with conclusive findings.
- Identify and reprimand/prosecute agents violating protocol (including players).
- Uncover external threats like the Syndicate.
- Maintain TID's reputation for impartiality and thoroughness.

## Connections
- Temporal Integrity Department (TID): Investigator
- All TCD Departments: Oversight/Potential Investigation Target
- Quinn Sterling (Tech Specialist): Potential awkward family connection
- Chronosynclastic Syndicate: Investigative Target

## Development Potential
Could remain a persistent antagonist, representing the inflexible bureaucracy. Alternatively, if players can provide irrefutable evidence of a greater threat or corruption *within* the rules, he might become a powerful, albeit difficult, ally. His potential family ties to Quinn add another layer. Could be revealed to have hidden depths or vulnerabilities.

## Reaction to Players
Treats them with professional suspicion and cold formality. Any deviation from protocol will be noted. Honest and by-the-book players might earn grudging neutrality, but he is unlikely to become 'friendly'. Players attempting to obstruct or deceive him face severe consequences if discovered. Might respond positively to logical arguments and hard evidence, but never emotional appeals.
