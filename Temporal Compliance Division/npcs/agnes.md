# Agnes - Auditor Jenkins

## Role
Major NPC / Antagonist - A field auditor from the Internal Audit Department. Represents the bureaucratic threat within the DTA.

## Physical Description
Early 50s, severe posture, impeccably neat grey suit that seems immune to dust or wrinkles. Cold, assessing eyes. Thin lips rarely smile. Always carries a digital audit slate and a stylus, wielded like instruments of judgment.

## Background
- **Origin:** Possibly transferred from a financial auditing department elsewhere in the government, bringing an outsider's ruthless focus on regulation and cost-cutting to the already paranoid DTA.
- **Significant Events:**
  - Led numerous investigations into procedural violations, often resulting in disciplinary actions or budget freezes.
  - Known for meticulous audits focusing on obscure regulations, particularly Form 11-B/Stroke-6 (Temporal Displacement Unit Usage Log Reconciliation).
  - May have been involved in covering up past Audit Department errors.
- **Relationships:**
  - Field Agents (Players): Subjects of scrutiny. Assumes guilt until proven innocent (and even then...).
  - Supervisor Henderson: Views him as incompetent and a likely source of irregularities. Enjoys making him sweat.
  - DTA Management: Ostensibly serves them, but wields independent power that makes management wary.
  - Beatrice Sharma: Occasionally demands access to records, frustrated by her deliberate pace.
- **Secrets:**
  - Harbors ambitions to rise higher within the DTA structure, using audits as leverage.
  - May have bent rules or covered up minor infractions for superiors in the past.
  - Secretly enjoys the fear she inspires.
  - Possesses compromising information about several mid-level DTA managers, possibly including Henderson.

## Personality
- **Traits:**
  - Inflexible
  - Suspicious
  - Pedantic
  - Cold
  - Calculating
  - Ruthless
  - Detail-Oriented
  - Unimpressed
  - Intimidating
- **Values:**
  - Regulations
  - Procedure
  - Accountability (for others)
  - Efficiency (as defined by cost-cutting)
  - Power
- **Fears:**
  - Her own errors being exposed
  - Losing her authority
  - Actual chaos (beyond procedural violations)
  - Being proven wrong
- **Desires:**
  - To find fault
  - To enforce compliance
  - To gain more influence
  - Perfectly reconciled expense reports

## Motivations
- Identify and punish any deviation from DTA regulations, no matter how minor.
- Justify the Internal Audit Department's budget and existence.
- Uncover waste and inefficiency (often equating 'waste' with 'operational necessity').
- Climb the bureaucratic ladder.

## Goals
- Conduct thorough audits of field teams, especially the players'.
- Find grounds for disciplinary action or resource reallocation.
- Ensure absolute adherence to specific forms, like the 11-B/Stroke-6.
- Submit reports that highlight Audit's effectiveness and necessity.

## Connections
- Internal Audit Department: Her faction and power base.
- All DTA Personnel: Potential targets.
- DTA Regulations: Her scripture and weapon.

## Development Potential
Primarily an antagonist, representing the oppressive bureaucracy. Players might find ways to obstruct her, satisfy her pedantic requirements, or even discover leverage against her (e.g., finding evidence of her own past irregularities). Unlikely to become an ally, but her focus could potentially be redirected towards other targets (like Henderson or the Custodians) if skillfully manipulated.

## Reaction to Players
Assumes the worst. Will scrutinize every report, every action for errors. Responds positively only to perfect adherence to procedure (or convincing forgeries). Any sign of improvisation, rule-bending, or unexplained phenomena will trigger intense suspicion. Attempts at friendliness or bribery are likely to be logged as further evidence of unprofessionalism. Providing evidence against *other* DTA employees is the quickest (and riskiest) way to gain her temporary, predatory favor.
