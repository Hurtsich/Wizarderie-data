# Arthur - Supervisor Henderson

## Role
Major NPC - The players' direct superior. Embodies stressed, ineffective middle management. Gives mission briefings, handles initial paperwork, allocates blame.

## Physical Description
Mid-50s, receding hairline often beaded with sweat, slightly rumpled DTA-standard beige short-sleeved shirt and tie (usually loosened). Eyes dart nervously. Constantly fiddles with a pen or a stack of forms. Often seen clutching a lukewarm cup of coffee.

## Background
- **Origin:** Likely a former field agent who got promoted due to seniority or bureaucratic maneuvering rather than competence. Has been with the DTA for decades.
- **Significant Events:**
  - Survived the 'Great Stapler Incident of '88', possibly by hiding.
  - Authored the infamous 'Henderson Directive' on proactive anomaly mitigation, which backfired spectacularly, increasing his paranoia about initiatives.
  - Presided over the disastrous 'Founding Day Potluck Disaster' investigation.
- **Relationships:**
  - Field Agents (Players): Direct reports. Views them as necessary nuisances and potential sources of blame.
  - Internal Audit Department: Deep fear and paranoia. Will avoid interaction if possible.
  - DTA Higher Management: Pressure from above to meet quotas (cheaply).
  - Beatrice Sharma (Archivist): Relies on her for finding obscure regulations but finds her pedantic.
  - Gary 'Gaz' Higgins (Maintenance): Constantly nags him about broken equipment, dismisses his complaints about budget.
- **Secrets:**
  - Maintains a meticulously hidden stash of decent (not great, just decent) instant coffee.
  - Knows the 'Henderson Directive' caused more problems than reported and actively buried evidence.
  - Secretly terrified that one of the 'minor' anomalies his teams handle will trigger something major, ending his career.

## Personality
- **Traits:**
  - Stressed
  - Risk-Averse
  - Bureaucratic
  - Paranoid
  - Sweaty
  - Easily Flustered
  - Cynical
  - Occasionally Resigned
- **Values:**
  - Following Procedure (to avoid blame)
  - Maintaining the Status Quo
  - Plausible Deniability
  - Job Security
- **Fears:**
  - Internal Audit
  - Making Decisions
  - Taking Responsibility
  - Major Paradoxes
  - Running out of coffee
- **Desires:**
  - A quiet life
  - Retirement
  - Someone else to take the fall
  - A functioning coffee machine

## Motivations
- Avoid blame for mission failures or procedural errors.
- Keep his section's budget from being cut further.
- Meet performance metrics set by superiors, however arbitrary.
- Survive until retirement without causing a major temporal incident.

## Goals
- Ensure mission reports are filed correctly (regardless of mission success).
- Allocate blame effectively during Post-Mission Debriefing & Blame Allocation Meetings.
- Secure enough BAUs to keep the lights on (metaphorically).
- Find his secret coffee stash undisturbed each morning.

## Connections
- DTA Management: Receives orders and pressure.
- Internal Audit: Subject to investigations and fear.
- Players: Direct Supervisor.
- Records Archive (Bea Sharma): Information Source.
- Maintenance (Gaz Higgins): Operational necessity.

## Development Potential
Could potentially be won over by competent agents who make his life easier (or cover for his mistakes). Might reveal hidden depths or surprising competence under extreme pressure. Could also serve as a scapegoat or be driven to a breakdown by mounting pressure or player actions. Might reveal crucial information about past DTA mistakes if desperate.

## Reaction to Players
Initially wary and demanding. Will appreciate agents who follow procedures (or appear to) and don't cause waves. Will react poorly to agents who question his authority, cause paradoxes, or attract the attention of Internal Audit. Can be swayed by flattery, appeals to procedure, or (carefully) implying a shared threat from Audit/management.
