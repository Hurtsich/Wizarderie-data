# Beatrice - 'Bea' Sharma, Lead Archivist

## Role
Minor NPC - Gatekeeper of the DTA Records Archive. A source of information, rumors, and bureaucratic hurdles.

## Physical Description
Late 60s, sharp eyes behind thick-rimmed glasses often perched on the end of her nose. Hair in a neat, tight bun. Wears practical, slightly dated clothing perpetually covered in a fine layer of dust. Moves with surprising quietness through the aisles.

## Background
- **Origin:** Joined the DTA (or its predecessor) in its early days, possibly as a secretary, and found her niche in organizing the chaotic records. Has outlasted numerous directors and policy changes.
- **Significant Events:**
  - Personally filed the initial reports on the 'First Recorded Anomaly Cleanup'.
  - Organized the archive after the 'Great Stapler Incident' scattered documents across time (a task she still complains about).
  - Witnessed the rise and fall of many agents, including whispers about the 'Phantom Agent of Sector Null'.
- **Relationships:**
  - Supervisor Henderson: Finds him incompetent but follows his official requests (slowly).
  - Internal Audit: Dislikes their attempts to access restricted files but respects their authority.
  - Field Agents (Players): Tolerates them if they respect her system; can be helpful if approached correctly.
  - Gary 'Gaz' Higgins: Sometimes commiserates about the lack of resources.
- **Secrets:**
  - Knows the location of several 'lost' or heavily redacted files concerning past DTA failures or controversial operations.
  - Maintains her own shadow filing system cross-referencing official records with her personal observations.
  - Secretly knows more about the 'Phantom Agent of Sector Null' than she lets on.
  - Has 'accidentally' misfiled embarrassing documents belonging to auditors or managers she dislikes.

## Personality
- **Traits:**
  - Pedantic
  - Territorial
  - Organized (to her own system)
  - Knowledgeable (about DTA history)
  - Patient
  - Observant
  - Dry Wit
  - Resistant to Change
- **Values:**
  - Order (her version of it)
  - Accuracy
  - Quiet
  - Proper Procedure (for archive requests)
  - History
- **Fears:**
  - Disruption of her archive
  - Losing historical records
  - Major system changes
  - Silverfish (temporal or otherwise)
- **Desires:**
  - To be left alone to manage her archive
  - Recognition of her importance
  - A decent cup of non-reconstituted tea
  - Researchers who fill out Form AR-3 correctly

## Motivations
- Preserve the integrity and organization of the DTA Records Archive.
- Ensure proper procedures are followed for accessing information.
- Protect sensitive or 'historically significant' records from careless agents or ambitious auditors.
- Maintain her domain against all intrusions.

## Goals
- Keep the archive meticulously organized according to her unique system.
- Successfully locate requested documents (if she deems the requester worthy).
- Gather gossip and information by observing who requests what.
- Ensure all archival request forms (AR-3) are filled out in triplicate.

## Connections
- DTA Records Archive: Her domain.
- All DTA Personnel: Potential requesters/annoyances.
- DTA History: Living repository.

## Development Potential
Can become a valuable, albeit prickly, ally providing crucial information or context if the players earn her trust (or offer suitable bribes, like rare historical teas or functional archival tape). Could also obstruct investigations if she disapproves of the players' methods or goals. Might hold the key to uncovering major secrets or past scandals.

## Reaction to Players
Initially dismissive and procedure-focused. Warms slightly to agents who show respect for the archive, demonstrate patience, and follow her rules. Dislikes agents who are demanding, messy, or try to circumvent procedures. Offering rare teas, historically accurate snacks, or useful (non-disruptive) information can improve relations. Will stonewall agents she dislikes or suspects of improper motives.
