# Beatrice Pettygrew - Archivist, Archive Annex

## Role
Minor NPC. Gatekeeper of historical records and confiscated anomalies. Can be a source of information (if navigated correctly) or bureaucratic obstruction. Possibly related to Janice Pettygrew (HR).

## Physical Description
Ageless, could be 50 or timeless due to minor temporal leakage in the Annex. Severe hairstyle, thick glasses perched on her nose. Moves silently amongst the towering shelves. Wears cardigans regardless of temporal climate setting. Smells of old data slates and dust.

## Background
- **Origin:** Has worked in the Archive Annex for an indeterminate amount of time. Knows the location of nearly every file, even the ones officially 'lost'.
- **Significant Events:**
  - Cataloged items from countless paradox cleanups
  - Witnessed minor temporal leaks within the Annex
  - Expert navigator of the Annex's arcane filing system
- **Relationships:**
  - Players (MIU Agents): Occasional Annoyances; disrupt her quiet order with requests.
  - Supervisor Mallory Vance: Formal Requests; likely finds Mallory overly anxious.
  - Agent Silas Sterling (TID): Respectful Compliance; TID gets priority access.
  - Janice Pettygrew (HR): Possible sister/relative; share a fondness for rigid procedures.
  - Confiscated Anomalies: Silent Companions; may talk to particularly interesting items.
- **Secrets:**
  - Knows the location of several heavily redacted or 'missing' files (like the full Stapler Incident report).
  - Aware of unauthorized access attempts in the past.
  - May have her own system for tracking particularly dangerous anomalies.
  - Secretly enjoys historical romance data-novels.

## Motivations
- Maintain the integrity and order of the Archive Annex.
- Ensure proper procedures are followed for accessing records.
- Protect the archives from damage or loss.

## Goals
- Fulfill official information requests accurately.
- Prevent unauthorized access.
- Keep the dust levels to a minimum.

## Connections
- Archive Annex: Domain/Workplace
- All TCD Departments: Information Seekers
- Janice Pettygrew (HR): Potential family/shared mindset

## Development Potential
Can be a source of vital information or a frustrating roadblock. Building rapport (or finding leverage) might grant access to restricted files crucial for investigating conspiracies. Could provide cryptic clues based on her extensive knowledge of past TCD mistakes.

## Reaction to Players
Initially indifferent and strictly procedural. Responds best to polite requests with correctly filled-out forms (Form 37b-Annex-Request). Annoyed by impatience or attempts to bend the rules. Might offer slightly more help if shown respect for the archives or if players can assist her with a minor archival task.
