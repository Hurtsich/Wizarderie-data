# Bob Jenkins - Senior Field Agent, MIU

## Role
Minor NPC. Jaded, seen-it-all veteran MIU agent. Offers cynical advice, cautionary tales, and maybe useful tips learned the hard way. Close to retirement.

## Physical Description
Late 50s, weary lines etched on his face. Slightly overweight, uniform perpetually rumpled. Moves with the slow deliberation of someone saving their energy. Often found near the coffee machine in Sector 7G. Has a 'World's Okayest Temporal Agent' mug.

  - Worked when MIU had slightly better equipment
  - Survived multiple Induction Chamber malfunctions
  - Lost partners to temporal accidents or bureaucratic reshuffling
- **Relationships:**
  - Players (MIU Agents): Newbies; views them with a mix of pity and weary mentorship.
  - Supervisor Mallory Vance: Current Boss; complies minimally, avoids drawing attention.
  - Quinn Sterling (Tech): Fellow Survivor; shares cynical banter.
  - TCD: The Job; something to endure until retirement.
- **Secrets:**
  - Knows shortcuts through Chronos Tower bureaucracy.
  - Has a stash of 'acquired' supplies hidden somewhere.

## Development Potential
Can serve as a source of cynical wisdom, rumors, and practical advice on navigating TCD. Might possess crucial forgotten knowledge about past events or personnel (like Thorne). Could be motivated to help the players if it aligns with his survival or sense of weary justice.

## Reaction to Players
Initially gruff and dismissive. Might offer unsolicited, cynical advice. Can be won over by listening to his stories, sharing coffee, or demonstrating competence that doesn't create more work for him. Will warn players against being heroes or trusting management.
