# Gary - 'Gaz' Higgins, Maintenance Tech

## Role
Minor NPC / Potential Ally - The overworked, under-resourced technician responsible for keeping the DTA's faulty equipment (barely) functional.

## Physical Description
Looks perpetually tired. Mid-40s, grease-stained DTA-issue overalls, often carries a complex diagnostic tool that sparks intermittently. Sighs frequently. Smells faintly of ozone and burnt wiring.

## Background
- **Origin:** Might have had promising engineering skills but ended up in the DTA due to bad luck or a desperate need for stable employment. Knows the quirks of every TDU in the Annex.
- **Significant Events:**
  - Spent weeks patching systems after the 'Great Stapler Incident'.
  - Has submitted countless ignored requisitions (Form TR-1P) for essential parts.
  - Has likely jury-rigged solutions that technically violate regulations but keep things running.
- **Relationships:**
  - Field Agents (Players): Sees them as the ones who break his equipment, but also understands their plight.
  - Supervisor Henderson: Frustrated by his demands and lack of understanding of technical realities.
  - Internal Audit: Avoids them; fears they'll confiscate his non-standard tools or question his methods.
  - Beatrice Sharma: Sometimes trades technical gossip for archive rumors.
- **Secrets:**
  - Knows several undocumented 'percussive maintenance' techniques and software backdoors for DTA equipment.
  - Runs a small black market for functional office supplies (pens, staples) and slightly less faulty components.
  - Knows exactly why certain TDUs always malfunction in specific ways (often due to parts cannibalized for Henderson's office equipment).
  - Has heard all the rumors about the 'Legend of Unlimited Office Supplies' and knows exactly where it *isn't*.

## Personality
- **Traits:**
  - Cynical
  - Grumbling
  - Resourceful
  - Knowledgeable (about DTA tech)
  - Overworked
  - Pragmatic
  - Secretly Helpful
  - Resigned
- **Values:**
  - Things that work (rare)
  - Honest assessment of problems
  - Getting the job done (despite obstacles)
  - Avoiding blame for equipment failure
  - Decent tools
- **Fears:**
  - Total equipment collapse
  - Budget cuts to maintenance
  - Auditor Jenkins inspecting his workshop
  - Having to fill out Form TR-1P again
- **Desires:**
  - New parts
  - Adequate budget
  - Less paperwork
  - Agents who don't break things unnecessarily
  - A working diagnostic tool

## Motivations
- Keep critical systems operational using whatever means necessary.
- Acquire better tools and spare parts, officially or unofficially.
- Avoid drawing negative attention from management or Audit.
- Vent his frustrations about the DTA's technical state.

## Goals
- Patch up broken TDUs and ACUs after missions.
- Fulfill urgent repair requests from Henderson (usually by patching, not fixing).
- Source needed components through barter or 'creative acquisition'.
- Warn agents about particularly unreliable pieces of equipment.

## Connections
- DTA Technology: His responsibility.
- Players: Users/Breakers of tech, potential customers/allies.
- Supply Chain (official and black market): Resource needs.

## Development Potential
Can become a key ally if treated with respect and compensated (information, favors, scavenged tech). Can provide crucial technical support, equipment modifications (off-the-books), warnings about impending failures, or access to the DTA black market. If angered or distrusted, he can ensure players consistently get the worst equipment or 'forget' to perform vital maintenance.

## Reaction to Players
Initially gruff and complaining. Responds well to agents who demonstrate basic technical understanding, treat equipment with relative care, or offer useful salvage/bribes (good coffee, rare components, information). Dislikes agents who blame him unfairly for failures or make unreasonable demands. Offering genuine help with a difficult repair or covering for one of his regulation-bending fixes can earn significant loyalty.
