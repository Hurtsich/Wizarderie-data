# Janice Pettygrew - Compliance Facilitator, Human Resources

Minor NPC. Represents the soul-crushing aspect of TCD's HR department. Handles mandatory training, performance reviews (the paperwork side), and disciplinary filings. Possibly related to Beatrice Pettygrew (Archivist).

## Physical Description
Indeterminate middle age. Perfectly neutral expression, seemingly permanently affixed. Wears regulation attire that somehow looks even blander than everyone else's. Speaks in calm, modulated tones, heavy with HR jargon and acronyms. Desk is unnervingly tidy.

  - Supervisor Mallory Vance: Procedural contact; likely involves performance review paperwork.
- **Secrets:**
  - Secretly judges everyone's adherence to the dress code.
  - Knows precisely which regulation covers almost any situation.
  - May be aware of irregularities in personnel files but considers it outside her purview unless formally reported.

## Development Potential
Primarily serves as a representation of dehumanizing bureaucracy. Unlikely to change significantly, but interacting with her might be necessary for certain procedural hurdles (transfers, filing grievances, etc.). Could possess records that, if accessed, might reveal hidden personnel histories.

## Reaction to Players
Polite, neutral, and strictly professional. Will answer questions by referring to specific TCD regulations or forms. Unresponsive to emotional appeals or attempts to bend rules. Following her procedures exactly is the only way to get anything done through her.
