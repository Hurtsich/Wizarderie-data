# Mallory Vance - Supervisor, Minor Infractions Unit (MIU)

## Role
Major NPC. The players' direct superior. Assigns missions, manages MIU's meager resources, enforces TCD protocols (often anxiously). Acts as a primary source of conflict related to bureaucracy and budget limitations, but potentially a reluctant ally.

## Physical Description
Mid-40s, perpetually frazzled appearance. Hair often slightly askew in a tight bun. Eyes dart nervously, scanning reports or the ceiling tiles. Favors slightly-too-tight, regulation grey pantsuits. Constantly clutches a datapad displaying budget spreadsheets or compliance checklists. Smells faintly of stale coffee and ozone.

## Background
- **Origin:** Joined TCD seeking stability after a chaotic early career (details vague). Rapidly promoted to MIU Supervisor after her predecessor's abrupt 'early retirement' following the infamous 'Stapler Incident'.
- **Significant Events:**
  - Witnessing fallout from 'The Stapler Incident'
  - Unexpected promotion to Supervisor
  - Navigating 'The Budget Purge of Cycle 78' impacts on MIU
  - Constantly dealing with faulty equipment requests
- **Relationships:**
  - Players (MIU Agents): Subordinates; views them as necessary but risky assets, prone to causing paperwork.
  - Agent Rex Vance (MED): Ambitious Cousin; resents his condescension and better resources.
  - Agent Silas Sterling (TID): Cautious/Fearful; views TID as a constant threat to her precarious position.
  - Quinn Sterling (Tech Specialist): Reliant/Strained; depends on Quinn to keep things running but frustrated by resource limits.
  - Director Evelyn Thorne: Distant Superior; seeks approval/avoidance of negative attention.
  - Previous MIU Supervisor: Unspoken history; took over after their 'retirement'.
- **Secrets:**
  - Knows more about the circumstances of her predecessor's 'retirement' than she lets on.
  - Secretly terrified of another 'Stapler Incident' ruining her career.
  - May have slightly bent rules in the past to secure her promotion or current position.
  - Keeps a hidden stash of surprisingly good coffee.

## Personality
- **Traits:**
  - Anxious
  - Bureaucratic
  - Risk-averse
  - Micromanager
  - Pragmatic
  - Secretly Weary
  - Occasionally shows flashes of competence/humanity
- **Values:**
  - Following Procedure (mostly)
  - Maintaining Order (within MIU)
  - Budget Adherence
  - Job Security
  - Avoiding Trouble
- **Fears:**
  - Scrutiny from TID
  - Budget cuts
  - Major mission failure traced to MIU
  - Losing her job
  - Cockroaches (temporal or otherwise)
- **Desires:**
  - A larger budget
  - Reliable equipment
  - Agents who file reports correctly
  - Recognition from upper management (or just being left alone)
  - Early retirement (eventually)

## Motivations
- Keep MIU functioning despite limitations.
- Avoid any incident that attracts negative attention from TID or MED.
- Meet performance quotas set by unseen superiors.
- Protect her own position and pension.

## Goals
- Ensure all mission reports are filed correctly and on time.
- Minimize resource expenditure on missions.
- Prevent any MIU action from escalating into a Major Event.
- Potentially gain slightly more resources or autonomy for MIU (if safe to do so).

## Connections
- Minor Infractions Unit (MIU): Supervisor
- Major Events Division (MED): Rivalry/Resentment (especially towards Rex Vance)
- Temporal Integrity Department (TID): Fear/Compliance
- Requisition Hub Delta: Frequent (frustrated) visitor
- Historical Events: Deeply scarred by 'The Stapler Incident' and her predecessor's fate.

## Development Potential
Can evolve from a purely bureaucratic obstacle to a reluctant ally if players prove competent and trustworthy. Could be pushed to bend rules if the situation becomes dire enough, or conversely, could betray the players to save herself. Her secrets could become leverage.

## Reaction to Players
Initially treats them with cautious mistrust, emphasizing rules and budget. Rewards strict adherence to protocol (even if inefficient). Punishes mistakes with extra paperwork or undesirable tasks. Can be swayed by successful missions completed under budget and without incident. Will react poorly to recklessness or attracting TID attention, but might secretly appreciate players who solve problems she can't.
