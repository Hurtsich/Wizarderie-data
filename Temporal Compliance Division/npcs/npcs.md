# NPCs

## Mallory Vance - Supervisor, Minor Infractions Unit (MIU)
**Role:** Major NPC. The players' direct superior. Assigns missions, manages MIU's meager resources, enforces TCD protocols (often anxiously). Acts as a primary source of conflict related to bureaucracy and budget limitations, but potentially a reluctant ally.

**Physical Description:** Mid-40s, perpetually frazzled appearance. Hair often slightly askew in a tight bun. Eyes dart nervously, scanning reports or the ceiling tiles. Favors slightly-too-tight, regulation grey pantsuits. Constantly clutches a datapad displaying budget spreadsheets or compliance checklists. Smells faintly of stale coffee and ozone.

**Background:**
- **Origin:** Joined TCD seeking stability after a chaotic early career (details vague). Rapidly promoted to MIU Supervisor after her predecessor's abrupt 'early retirement' following the infamous 'Stapler Incident'.
- **Significant Events:**
  - Witnessing fallout from 'The Stapler Incident'
  - Unexpected promotion to Supervisor
  - Navigating 'The Budget Purge of Cycle 78' impacts on MIU
  - Constantly dealing with faulty equipment requests
- **Relationships:**
  - Players (MIU Agents): Subordinates; views them as necessary but risky assets, prone to causing paperwork.
  - Agent Rex Vance (MED): Ambitious Cousin; resents his condescension and better resources.
  - Agent Silas Sterling (TID): Cautious/Fearful; views TID as a constant threat to her precarious position.
  - Quinn Sterling (Tech Specialist): Reliant/Strained; depends on Quinn to keep things running but frustrated by resource limits.
  - Director Evelyn Thorne: Distant Superior; seeks approval/avoidance of negative attention.
  - Previous MIU Supervisor: Unspoken history; took over after their 'retirement'.
- **Secrets:**
  - Knows more about the circumstances of her predecessor's 'retirement' than she lets on.
  - Secretly terrified of another 'Stapler Incident' ruining her career.
  - May have slightly bent rules in the past to secure her promotion or current position.
  - Keeps a hidden stash of surprisingly good coffee.

**Personality:**
- **Traits:**

  - Secretly Weary
  - Occasionally shows flashes of competence/humanity
- **Values:**
  - Following Procedure (mostly)
  - Maintaining Order (within MIU)
  - Budget Adherence
  - Job Security
  - Avoiding Trouble
- **Fears:**
  - Scrutiny from TID

  - Cockroaches (temporal or otherwise)
- **Desires:**
  - A larger budget
  - Reliable equipment

**Goals:**
- Ensure all mission reports are filed correctly and on time.
- Minimize resource expenditure on missions.
- Prevent any MIU action from escalating into a Major Event.
- Potentially gain slightly more resources or autonomy for MIU (if safe to do so).

**Connections:**
- Minor Infractions Unit (MIU): Supervisor
- Major Events Division (MED): Rivalry/Resentment (especially towards Rex Vance)
- Temporal Integrity Department (TID): Fear/Compliance
- Requisition Hub Delta: Frequent (frustrated) visitor
- Historical Events: Deeply scarred by 'The Stapler Incident' and her predecessor's fate.

**Development Potential:** Can evolve from a purely bureaucratic obstacle to a reluctant ally if players prove competent and trustworthy. Could be pushed to bend rules if the situation becomes dire enough, or conversely, could betray the players to save herself. Her secrets could become leverage.

**Reaction to Players:** Initially treats them with cautious mistrust, emphasizing rules and budget. Rewards strict adherence to protocol (even if inefficient). Punishes mistakes with extra paperwork or undesirable tasks. Can be swayed by successful missions completed under budget and without incident. Will react poorly to recklessness or attracting TID attention, but might secretly appreciate players who solve problems she can't.
## Quinn Sterling - Lead Tech Specialist (Unofficial), MIU Support Staff
**Role:** Major NPC. Responsible for maintaining MIU's faulty equipment. Cynical, overworked, and under-resourced, but possesses genuine technical skill (often used for jury-rigging). Source of exposition on tech limitations, potential provider of 'off-spec' modifications.

**Physical Description:** Late 20s/Early 30s, perpetually tired eyes behind thick-rimmed glasses often smudged with grease. Wears stained TCD-issue coveralls over band t-shirts. Hands usually busy tinkering with a malfunctioning device. Often smells of solder, coffee, and desperation. May or may not be related to Silas Sterling of TID.

**Background:**
- **Origin:** Joined TCD thinking it would be cutting-edge tech work; quickly disillusioned by the reality of the budget-starved agency, especially MIU.
- **Significant Events:**
  - Survived 'The Budget Purge of Cycle 78' (barely)
  - Constantly patching Temporal Induction Chamber glitches
  - Mastered the art of percussive maintenance on Paradox Scanners

  - Players (MIU Agents): Fellow sufferers; respects competence, annoyed by carelessness that breaks gear.
  - Supervisor Mallory Vance: Strained; constantly fielding her requests for impossible repairs with no parts.
  - Agent Silas Sterling (TID): Possible estranged sibling/relative; relationship is tense and avoided if true.
  - Chloe Quinn (Intern): Mentee/Burden; trying to teach her the ropes, often exasperated.
  - Requisition Hub Delta Staff: Mutual Resignation; knows all the loopholes and delays.
- **Secrets:**
  - Runs a side-hustle bartering repaired personal electronics for off-ration supplies.
  - Knows several unauthorized backdoors into TCD systems (rarely uses them).

**Goals:**
- Fulfill repair requests within impossible constraints.

**Connections:**
- Sector 7G (MIU Office): Primary workspace
- Temporal Induction Chamber: Frequent repair site
- Requisition Hub Delta: Source of frustration and occasional parts
- Agent Silas Sterling (TID): Potential awkward family connection
- Chloe Quinn (Intern): Direct report

**Development Potential:** Can become a crucial ally, providing technical solutions and potentially illegal modifications. Could be persuaded to help investigate internal sabotage or access restricted systems if convinced it's necessary or sufficiently anti-bureaucratic. Their potential connection to Silas Sterling offers roleplaying and plot hooks.

**Reaction to Players:** Initially treats them with weary cynicism. Appreciates agents who understand the tech's limitations and don't break things carelessly. Can be won over by competence, shared complaining about the TCD, or bribes (good coffee, rare parts). Dislikes agents who are demanding or act superior. Might offer 'off-the-record' help if trusted.
## Agent Silas Sterling - Investigator, Temporal Integrity Department (TID)
**Role:** Major NPC/Antagonist/Potential Ally. Represents the ever-present threat of internal affairs. Cold, calculating, and devoted to TCD protocol. Investigates irregularities, agent misconduct, and paradox contamination. May be related to Quinn Sterling.

**Physical Description:** Early 30s, sharp, impeccable appearance. Always in a perfectly pressed regulation suit. Moves with quiet precision. Eyes are observant and miss little. Face rarely shows emotion, maintaining a neutral, professional mask. Carries an air of quiet authority and judgment.

**Background:**
- **Origin:** Possibly from a family with TCD history (Sterling name connection?). Excelled in TCD academy, specifically chosen for TID due to meticulous nature and unwavering belief in regulations.
- **Significant Events:**
  - Involved in the investigation following 'The Stapler Incident'
  - Handled several high-profile (internal) agent misconduct cases
  - Known for thoroughness and incorruptibility (or perceived lack of empathy)
  - Consistently receives high performance reviews
- **Relationships:**
  - Players (MIU Agents): Subjects of potential investigation; views them with professional suspicion.
  - Supervisor Mallory Vance: Scrutiny; aware of her anxiety and potential weaknesses.
  - Agent Rex Vance (MED): Professional distance; likely views MED arrogance as a potential compliance risk.
  - Quinn Sterling (Tech Specialist): Possible estranged sibling/relative; interactions are cold and formal, hinting at unspoken history.
  - TID Leadership: Loyal Subordinate; dedicated to TID's mission.
  - Chronosynclastic Syndicate: Primary Target; sees them as the ultimate violation of temporal integrity.
- **Secrets:**
  - May harbor secret doubts about certain TCD protocols but believes the system is paramount.
  - Potentially covering for a past mistake made by himself or a superior.
  - The nature of his relationship with Quinn Sterling is hidden.
  - Might be aware of deeper conspiracies (like Oversight Committee issues) but focuses only on protocol violations.
  - Could be secretly searching for the 'Anomaly Clock' for TID.

**Personality:**
- **Traits:**
  - Analytical
  - Methodical
  - Incorruptible (or appears so)
  - Judgmental

  - Being wrong

- Maintain TID's reputation for impartiality and thoroughness.

**Connections:**
- Temporal Integrity Department (TID): Investigator
- All TCD Departments: Oversight/Potential Investigation Target
- Quinn Sterling (Tech Specialist): Potential awkward family connection
- Chronosynclastic Syndicate: Investigative Target

**Development Potential:** Could remain a persistent antagonist, representing the inflexible bureaucracy. Alternatively, if players can provide irrefutable evidence of a greater threat or corruption *within* the rules, he might become a powerful, albeit difficult, ally. His potential family ties to Quinn add another layer. Could be revealed to have hidden depths or vulnerabilities.

**Reaction to Players:** Treats them with professional suspicion and cold formality. Any deviation from protocol will be noted. Honest and by-the-book players might earn grudging neutrality, but he is unlikely to become 'friendly'. Players attempting to obstruct or deceive him face severe consequences if discovered. Might respond positively to logical arguments and hard evidence, but never emotional appeals.
## Agent Rex Vance - Field Agent, Major Events Division (MED)
**Role:** Recurring NPC/Rival. Embodies the arrogance and better funding of MED. Looks down on MIU agents. May occasionally interfere with MIU missions (accidentally or intentionally) or compete for resources/recognition. Mallory's cousin.

**Physical Description:** Mid-30s, smug grin often playing on his lips. Wears slightly customized, higher-quality TCD gear. Carries himself with unearned confidence. Well-groomed, perhaps spends agency time polishing his temporal manipulator. Enjoys leaning casually against walls during conversations with MIU staff.

**Background:**

  - Supervisor Mallory Vance: Embarrassing Cousin; enjoys reminding her of MIU's lower status.
  - Agent Silas Sterling (TID): Cautious Avoidance; knows TID can target anyone, even MED 'stars'.
  - MED Colleagues: Competitive/Networking; constantly trying to climb the MED ladder.
- **Secrets:**
  - Possibly cut corners on a past MED mission, covered it up.
  - Secretly insecure about his actual competence compared to MED veterans.

**Development Potential:** Primarily serves as an antagonist/foil representing interdepartmental rivalry. Could potentially be humbled by events, forced to cooperate with MIU, or even become a source of information if his own position is threatened. His arrogance might lead him into trouble the players can exploit or resolve.

**Reaction to Players:** Condescending and dismissive. Will likely mock their equipment and assignments. Might interfere if mission areas overlap, prioritizing his own objectives. Could be manipulated by appealing to his ego or desire for glory, but is generally untrustworthy.
## Beatrice Pettygrew - Archivist, Archive Annex
**Role:** Minor NPC. Gatekeeper of historical records and confiscated anomalies. Can be a source of information (if navigated correctly) or bureaucratic obstruction. Possibly related to Janice Pettygrew (HR).

**Physical Description:** Ageless, could be 50 or timeless due to minor temporal leakage in the Annex. Severe hairstyle, thick glasses perched on her nose. Moves silently amongst the towering shelves. Wears cardigans regardless of temporal climate setting. Smells of old data slates and dust.

## Chloe Quinn - Intern, MIU Support Staff
**Role:** Minor NPC. Eager but naive intern, often tasked with menial jobs. Can be a source of accidental information leaks or minor assistance. Potential relation to Quinn Sterling.

**Reaction to Players:** Polite, neutral, and strictly professional. Will answer questions by referring to specific TCD regulations or forms. Unresponsive to emotional appeals or attempts to bend rules. Following her procedures exactly is the only way to get anything done through her.
## "Mr. Jones" - Temporal Broker / Information Dealer
**Role:** Minor NPC / Potential recurring contact. Represents the Chronosynclastic Syndicate or similar illicit temporal operations. Deals in forbidden artifacts, paradox tech, or sensitive information - for a price.

**Physical Description:** Appearance shifts subtly, often nondescript. Prefers dimly lit corners of temporal crossroads or neutral zones. Might appear as a man in a slightly-too-old suit one meeting, a woman in futuristic chrome the next. The only constant is watchful eyes and an unnerving calm.

**Reaction to Players:** Treats them cautiously and transactionally. Interested only in what they can offer (information, credits, access) or what can be exploited. Will likely test their discretion and competence. Provides reliable service if paid, but will not hesitate to betray them if advantageous or necessary for self-preservation.
