# Quinn Sterling - Lead Tech Specialist (Unofficial), MIU Support Staff

## Role
Major NPC. Responsible for maintaining MIU's faulty equipment. Cynical, overworked, and under-resourced, but possesses genuine technical skill (often used for jury-rigging). Source of exposition on tech limitations, potential provider of 'off-spec' modifications.

## Physical Description
Late 20s/Early 30s, perpetually tired eyes behind thick-rimmed glasses often smudged with grease. Wears stained TCD-issue coveralls over band t-shirts. Hands usually busy tinkering with a malfunctioning device. Often smells of solder, coffee, and desperation. May or may not be related to Silas Sterling of TID.

## Background
- **Origin:** Joined TCD thinking it would be cutting-edge tech work; quickly disillusioned by the reality of the budget-starved agency, especially MIU.
- **Significant Events:**
  - Survived 'The Budget Purge of Cycle 78' (barely)
  - Constantly patching Temporal Induction Chamber glitches
  - Mastered the art of percussive maintenance on Paradox Scanners
  - Rumored to have once rerouted cafeteria power to boost MIU's chroniton fuel regenerator (denied officially)
- **Relationships:**
  - Players (MIU Agents): Fellow sufferers; respects competence, annoyed by carelessness that breaks gear.
  - Supervisor Mallory Vance: Strained; constantly fielding her requests for impossible repairs with no parts.
  - Agent Silas Sterling (TID): Possible estranged sibling/relative; relationship is tense and avoided if true.
  - Chloe Quinn (Intern): Mentee/Burden; trying to teach her the ropes, often exasperated.
  - Requisition Hub Delta Staff: Mutual Resignation; knows all the loopholes and delays.
- **Secrets:**
  - Runs a side-hustle bartering repaired personal electronics for off-ration supplies.
  - Knows several unauthorized backdoors into TCD systems (rarely uses them).
  - Suspects some equipment failures are too convenient to be accidental.
  - Might be quietly documenting evidence of resource misallocation favouring MED.

## Personality
- **Traits:**
  - Cynical
  - Sarcastic
  - Resourceful
  - Overworked
  - Intelligent
  - Disillusioned
  - Secretly proud of keeping things running
- **Values:**
  - Competence
  - Things that *work*
  - Honesty (about how bad things are)
  - Getting through the shift
  - Coffee
- **Fears:**
  - Catastrophic equipment failure leading to agent loss
  - TID discovering unauthorized modifications
  - Being transferred to Archive Annex duty
  - Running out of coffee
- **Desires:**
  - Adequate funding/parts
  - Newer equipment
  - Appreciation for their work
  - A decent night's sleep
  - Transfer to MED (less likely now due to cynicism)

## Motivations
- Keep MIU agents alive despite faulty gear.
- Make equipment function through sheer ingenuity and willpower.
- Minimize own workload where possible.
- Stick it to the bureaucracy subtly when opportunities arise.

## Goals
- Fulfill repair requests within impossible constraints.
- Find clever workarounds for broken tech.
- Avoid attracting TID attention for unauthorized mods.
- Maybe, just maybe, get a new diagnostic tool that isn't from Cycle 60.

## Connections
- Sector 7G (MIU Office): Primary workspace
- Temporal Induction Chamber: Frequent repair site
- Requisition Hub Delta: Source of frustration and occasional parts
- Agent Silas Sterling (TID): Potential awkward family connection
- Chloe Quinn (Intern): Direct report

## Development Potential
Can become a crucial ally, providing technical solutions and potentially illegal modifications. Could be persuaded to help investigate internal sabotage or access restricted systems if convinced it's necessary or sufficiently anti-bureaucratic. Their potential connection to Silas Sterling offers roleplaying and plot hooks.

## Reaction to Players
Initially treats them with weary cynicism. Appreciates agents who understand the tech's limitations and don't break things carelessly. Can be won over by competence, shared complaining about the TCD, or bribes (good coffee, rare parts). Dislikes agents who are demanding or act superior. Might offer 'off-the-record' help if trusted.
