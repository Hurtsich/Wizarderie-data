# Reginald - Agent Thorne, Chronos Custodians

## Role
Minor NPC / Recurring Rival - An agent from the rival Chronos Custodians agency. Represents the petty competition between the two underfunded organizations.

## Physical Description
Late 30s, annoyingly smug expression. Wears the Custodians' slightly different (maybe just cleaner) beige uniform with excessive neatness. Carries slightly newer-looking, but probably equally faulty, equipment.

## Background
- **Origin:** Likely a mid-level agent in the Chronos Custodians, thoroughly indoctrinated in their supposed superiority.
- **Significant Events:**
  - Has likely had numerous minor run-ins with DTA agents over trivial anomalies.
  - Was probably reprimanded for losing a 'competitive anomaly retrieval' to the DTA at least once.
  - Is possibly responsible for leaving passive-aggressive notes at the Chronos Custodians Supply Closet.
- **Relationships:**
  - DTA Agents (Players): Primary rivals. Views them with contempt and condescension.
  - Chronos Custodians: His agency, which he believes is far superior despite evidence.
  - Supervisor Henderson: Likely views him as the epitome of DTA incompetence.
- **Secrets:**
  - Secretly envies some aspect of the DTA (perhaps their slightly less ridiculous acronym).
  - His agency's equipment is just as bad, if not worse, than the DTA's.
  - May have occasionally 'borrowed' supplies or data from the DTA.
  - Might have a grudging respect for the players' ability to succeed despite their affiliation.

## Personality
- **Traits:**
  - Smug
  - Arrogant
  - Competitive
  - By-the-book (his book)
  - Condescending
  - Prone to Monologue
  - Officious
- **Values:**
  - Chronos Custodians Superiority
  - Methodological Purity (as defined by Custodians)
  - One-Upmanship
  - Looking good
- **Fears:**
  - Being shown up by DTA agents
  - His own equipment failing publicly
  - His superiors finding out about his failures
  - DTA getting a bigger budget
- **Desires:**
  - To prove the Custodians are better
  - To capture anomalies before the DTA
  - Promotion within the Custodians
  - Acquiring slightly better gear

## Motivations
- Outperform DTA agents on anomaly cleanup missions.
- Gather intelligence on DTA operations (and weaknesses).
- Adhere strictly to Custodian protocols to demonstrate their superiority.
- Make snide remarks about DTA methods.

## Goals
- Successfully retrieve anomalies the players are also assigned to.
- File reports highlighting DTA errors or Custodian successes.
- Sabotage DTA efforts subtly (e.g., 'accidentally' triggering alarms, misdirecting historical figures).
- Obtain proof that the DTA's rumored better break room is a myth.

## Connections
- Chronos Custodians: Employer/Faction.
- Players: Rivals.
- Shared Anomaly Sites: Points of conflict.

## Development Potential
Could remain a persistent annoyance. Might escalate tactics if consistently beaten. In desperate situations (like facing a major temporal threat), could become a temporary, untrustworthy ally of convenience. Could potentially be 'flipped' or manipulated if his arrogance or agency loyalty is exploited.

## Reaction to Players
Defaults to smug condescension and rivalry. Will attempt to obstruct or outperform the players at every opportunity. Success against him might increase his frustration and pettiness. Showing competence might earn grudging (and unspoken) respect, but he'll never admit it. Cooperation is unlikely unless the situation is dire for both agencies.
