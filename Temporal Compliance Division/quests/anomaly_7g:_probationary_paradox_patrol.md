# Anomaly 7G: Probationary Paradox Patrol

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Main Story Quest
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Estimated Duration:** 1 Session (3-4 hours)

## Description
Your first official field mission as DTA Agents. Supervisor Henderson assigns you to handle a recurring minor contamination in Roman Market Anomaly Sector 7G â€“ retrieve an anachronistic object before it causes a Paradox Quotient spike above acceptable thresholds (as defined by Regulation 4C-Minor). Expect faulty equipment and excessive paperwork.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of DTA Onboarding (Character Creation/Introduction)

## Objectives
### Receive mission briefing from Supervisor Henderson.

**Success Conditions:**
- Attend briefing
- Receive mission parameters (Form M-1 Brief)
- Don't annoy Henderson *too* much

**Failure Conditions:**
- Miss briefing
- Anger Henderson sufficiently to get assigned latrine cleaning duty instead

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Henderson is particularly stressed and gives confusing/contradictory instructions
### Travel to Roman Market Anomaly Sector 7G via Temporal Displacement Unit (TDU).

**Success Conditions:**
- Arrive within the correct temporal/spatial coordinates (within DTA tolerance levels)

**Failure Conditions:**
- TDU Malfunction leads to significant temporal/spatial displacement (e.g., arriving a day late, inside a pottery kiln, or during a local riot)
- Attract unwanted attention upon arrival

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Minor TDU glitch deposits you nearby but in an inconvenient location (e.g., rooftop, midden heap)
- Arrive perfectly but equipment suffers minor damage
### Locate and retrieve the Temporal Contaminant (e.g., a plastic spork, half-eaten bag of chips).

**Success Conditions:**
- Identify the anachronism
- Secure it within an Anomaly Containment Unit (ACU) without causing significant historical disturbance

**Failure Conditions:**
- Fail to locate the object before Paradox Quotient rises
- Cause a public spectacle
- Damage the object making containment difficult
- Contaminate the area further

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Object has been moved by a local
- Object is partially integrated into the environment (e.g., used as a tool)
### Return to The Annex and file Post-Mission Report (Form PMR-Alpha).

**Success Conditions:**
- Successfully return via TDU
- File report mostly correctly
- Attend Post-Mission Debriefing & Blame Allocation Meeting

**Failure Conditions:**
- TDU fails on return trip
- Report is filed incorrectly leading to reprimand
- Agents blamed for TDU malfunction during debrief

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Report requires multiple revisions
- Debriefing interrupted by unrelated DTA chaos

## Key NPCs
- Arthur (Supervisor Henderson)

## Key Locations
- The Annex
- Temporal Relay Chamber
- Roman Market Anomaly Sector 7G

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Official completion of first mission (avoiding immediate probation).
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Minimal BAU allocation for next mission's supplies
  - Slightly less distrust from Henderson
  - Knowledge of TDU quirks
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - Finding a functional pen near the report submission tray
  - Overhearing useful gossip in the Break Room after the mission
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Department of Temporal Adjustments (DTA): + Minor (Competence Noted)
  - Supervisor Henderson: + Minor (Problem Solved/Not Caused)

## Branching Paths
- TDU Malfunction Handling: Report vs. Conceal vs. Improvise.
- Contaminant Retrieval Method: Stealth vs. Distraction vs. Minor Bribes/Barter.
- Report Filing: Meticulous vs. Rushed vs. Creative Interpretation.

## Optional Content
- Interact with historically inaccurate locals in Sector 7G.
- Find evidence of previous DTA missions (e.g., discarded ACU fragment).
- Attempt to use the faulty TDU scanners to find non-mission related temporal oddities (risky).
- Try to submit a Form TR-1P for better equipment (likely denied).
