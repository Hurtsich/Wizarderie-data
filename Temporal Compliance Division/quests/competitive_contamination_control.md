# Competitive Contamination Control

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Main Story Quest
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Estimated Duration:** 1-2 Sessions (4-6 hours)

## Description
A slightly higher-priority anomaly (e.g., suspiciously modern gardening tools appearing in 17th Century Versailles gardens) has been detected. Unfortunately, the rival Chronos Custodians are also dispatching a team. Henderson wants you to retrieve the anomaly *before* them, primarily to spite the Custodians and justify the DTA's budget. He strongly implies using Form TR-1P to requisition 'enhanced surveillance gear' is necessary, initiating a bureaucratic nightmare.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of 'Anomaly 7G: Probationary Paradox Patrol' or similar introductory mission

## Objectives
### Navigate the Requisition Process (Form TR-1P) for necessary gear.

**Success Conditions:**
- Successfully obtain the needed equipment (e.g., slightly less blurry binoculars) before the mission deadline

**Failure Conditions:**
- Fail to acquire gear due to bureaucratic delays or rejection
- Waste too much time, allowing Custodians a head start

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Acquire gear through unofficial channels (e.g., Gaz Higgins' black market, 'borrowing' from another department)
- Obtain wrong/faulty gear despite approved form
### Infiltrate the anomaly location (e.g., Versailles Gardens, 1685) and locate the temporal contaminants.

**Success Conditions:**
- Arrive undetected
- Identify contaminants before the Chronos Custodians team

**Failure Conditions:**
- Arrive late or conspicuously
- Custodians locate contaminants first
- Attract attention of historical guards

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Both teams arrive simultaneously
- Location is more complex/guarded than briefed
### Retrieve the contaminants while dealing with Chronos Custodians interference.

**Success Conditions:**
- Secure all contaminants
- Prevent Custodians (led by Agent Reginald Thorne) from securing them
- Minimize collateral damage/paradox

**Failure Conditions:**
- Custodians secure the contaminants
- Direct conflict causes significant historical disturbance
- Lose containment units or equipment to rivals

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- A tense standoff leads to negotiation/temporary truce
- Both teams accidentally trigger a larger temporal disturbance
- Contaminants are booby-trapped by Time Vandals
### Return and report mission outcome, emphasizing Custodian incompetence (regardless of reality).

**Success Conditions:**
- Return with contaminants
- File report favouring DTA
- Henderson is pleased with Custodian failure

**Failure Conditions:**
- Return empty-handed
- Report indicates DTA failure or significant issues
- Henderson is furious
- Attract Internal Audit scrutiny due to incident reports

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Return with partial success
- Evidence points to Time Vandal involvement, complicating the report

## Key NPCs
- Arthur (Supervisor Henderson)
- Reginald Thorne (Chronos Custodians Agent)
- Gary 'Gaz' Higgins (Potential source for gear/repairs)

## Key Locations
- The Annex
- Records Archive (for TR-1P process)
- Anomaly Site (e.g., Versailles Gardens)
- Possibly brief encounter near Chronos Custodians Supply Closet if pursuing unofficial avenues

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Successfully retrieving anomaly before Custodians: Henderson's temporary approval, slightly improved team standing.
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Confiscated (likely faulty) Custodian gadget
  - Bonus BAUs (minimal)
  - Intelligence on Custodian methods/tech
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - Discovering a weakness in Reginald Thorne's methods
  - Finding a shortcut through the TR-1P process for future use
  - Gaz Higgins owes you a favor if helped
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Department of Temporal Adjustments (DTA): +/- depending on success/failure vs Custodians
  - Chronos Custodians: - Significant (Rivalry Intensified)
  - Supervisor Henderson: +/- based on outcome
  - Internal Audit Department: + Minor Risk (Potential scrutiny if mission messy)

## Branching Paths
- Acquiring Gear: Official Bureaucracy vs. Black Market vs. 'Borrowing'.
- Dealing with Custodians: Direct Confrontation vs. Stealth/Sabotage vs. Temporary Cooperation.
- Reporting Outcome: Honest Assessment vs. Blame Deflection vs. Exaggerated Success.

## Optional Content
- Attempt to plant misleading evidence implicating Custodians for future issues.
- Try to steal something useful from the Chronos Custodians Supply Closet.
- Investigate *why* these specific tools appeared here (possible Time Vandal link?).
- Gather blackmail material on Reginald Thorne.
