# Custodial Kleptomania Recovery

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Faction Quest (Rivalry)
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Estimated Duration:** 1-2 Sessions (4-6 hours)

## Description
A sensitive piece of DTA diagnostic equipment (perhaps a prototype chroniton detector Gaz Higgins was 'beta testing') has gone missing from a recent anomaly site shared with the Chronos Custodians. Henderson is convinced Agent Reginald Thorne or his ilk 'borrowed' it. He tasks the team with infiltrating the Chronos Custodians Supply Closet and retrieving the device *discreetly*. Getting caught would cause an inter-agency incident (and lots of paperwork).

## Prerequisites
- Encountered Chronos Custodians/Reginald Thorne
- Awareness of the rivalry

## Objectives
### Receive the indignant mission briefing from Supervisor Henderson.

**Success Conditions:**
- Understand the objective: Retrieve stolen tech quietly
- Get details on the missing device and potential location (Chronos Custodians Supply Closet)

**Failure Conditions:**
- Refuse the mission
- Suggest diplomatic approach (likely rejected)

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Henderson provides inaccurate intel based on prejudice
- Gaz Higgins provides more accurate technical details about the device
### Plan and execute infiltration into the Chronos Custodians Supply Closet.

**Success Conditions:**
- Gain access to the Custodian location undetected
- Bypass any rudimentary security measures

**Failure Conditions:**
- Detected during approach or entry
- Unable to bypass security
- Wrong location targeted

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Find evidence of Custodian procedures/weaknesses
- Discover the area is unexpectedly busy
### Search the Chronos Custodians Supply Closet and locate the missing DTA device.

**Success Conditions:**
- Find the specific piece of equipment
- Confirm its identity

**Failure Conditions:**
- Device is not there
- Device is damaged or partially dismantled
- Alert Custodians (Reginald Thorne?) during search

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Find other potentially 'borrowed' DTA items
- Discover sensitive Custodian documents or plans
- Device found was genuinely misplaced, not stolen
### Exfiltrate the Custodian location with the device undetected.

**Success Conditions:**
- Leave the area without raising alarm
- Return to DTA territory with the device

**Failure Conditions:**
- Detected during escape
- Forced to abandon device
- Cause damage/leave evidence implicating DTA

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Retrieve additional items/intel
- Subtly sabotage Custodian supplies
### Return the device to Henderson (or Gaz).

**Success Conditions:**
- Present the retrieved device
- Report mission success (emphasizing Custodian perfidy)

**Failure Conditions:**
- Return empty-handed
- Return with wrong/damaged item
- Evidence of infiltration discovered by Custodians later

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Henderson takes credit for the recovery
- Gaz is grateful and offers a reward
- Recovery slightly improves DTA morale
