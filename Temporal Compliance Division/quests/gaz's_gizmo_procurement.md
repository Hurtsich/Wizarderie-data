# Gaz's Gizmo Procurement

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Personal Quest (Ally NPC)
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Estimated Duration:** 1-2 Sessions (4-6 hours)

## Description
Gary 'Gaz' Higgins pulls the team aside, whispering frantically. The Annex's main chroniton stabilizer (or maybe just the good coffee machine in the Break Room, Gaz is cagey) is on the fritz due to a failing 'Flux Coupler XJ-7', a part declared obsolete by Central Procurement decades ago. Standard requisition (Form TR-1P) is impossible. Gaz needs the team to either 'creatively source' one from a specific past timeline known for similar tech or navigate the bureaucratic nightmare of petitioning for a variance (Form 7B-Alpha Exception).

## Prerequisites
- Met Gary 'Gaz' Higgins
- Completed at least one mission

## Objectives
### Agree to help Gary 'Gaz' Higgins find the Flux Coupler XJ-7.

**Success Conditions:**
- Accept the quest from Gaz
- Receive details on the part and potential sourcing locations/times or the required forms

**Failure Conditions:**
- Refuse to help Gaz
- Report Gaz's request to Henderson or Audit

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Gaz offers a specific piece of slightly less faulty gear as collateral/reward
### Choose a procurement method: Timeline Scavenging or Bureaucratic Appeal.

**Success Conditions:**
- Commit to one path

**Failure Conditions:**
- Indecision leads to delays, worsening the equipment failure

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Attempt both simultaneously (inefficient)
### Path A: Travel to the designated timeline/location and acquire a functional Flux Coupler XJ-7.

**Success Conditions:**
- Successfully retrieve the part without causing significant paradox
- Evade any local security or temporal turbulence

**Failure Conditions:**
- Fail to find the part
- Cause a noticeable anachronism
- Damage the part during retrieval
- TDU malfunction strands team

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Part found is slightly different but adaptable by Gaz
- Encounter Time Vandals scavenging similar tech
### Path B: Navigate the DTA bureaucracy to get Form 7B-Alpha Exception approved.

**Success Conditions:**
- Successfully file form with all necessary (and likely contradictory) supporting documents
- Persuade/bribe relevant clerks or Beatrice Sharma for assistance
- Obtain approval signature (possibly Henderson's, requiring convincing)

**Failure Conditions:**
- Form rejected due to errors or lack of justification
- Process takes too long
- Attract negative attention from Internal Audit (Agnes Jenkins)

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover a loophole in the regulations
- Approval requires calling in a significant favor
### Deliver the Flux Coupler XJ-7 (or approved form) to Gaz Higgins.

**Success Conditions:**
- Gaz receives the required item/approval
- The critical equipment is stabilized

**Failure Conditions:**
- Part is incompatible/damaged beyond Gaz's ability to fix
- Approval is revoked last minute
- Gaz is blamed for the initial failure before the fix arrives

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Gaz fixes the device, significantly improving its function (e.g., coffee machine now brews excellent coffee)

## Key NPCs

  - Experience in timeline scavenging or DTA bureaucracy

## Branching Paths
- Procurement Method: Scavenging vs. Bureaucracy.
- Scavenging Approach: Stealth vs. Deception vs. Technical Exploitation.
- Bureaucracy Approach: By-the-book vs. Loopholes vs. Favors/Bribes.
