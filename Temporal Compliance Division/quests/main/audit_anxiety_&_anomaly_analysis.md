# Audit Anxiety & Anomaly Analysis

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** main story quest
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Estimated Duration:** 2-3 sessions

## Description
Supervisor Quill is panicking: Auditor Director Noctua has announced a surprise audit of Sector 7G! Simultaneously, recent 'minor' anomaly reports show disturbing similarities - repeating energy signatures, locations tied to old TCD projects. Juggle hiding 7G's corner-cutting from Noctua while secretly investigating the anomaly pattern, possibly needing access to the restricted Anomaly Archive.

## Prerequisites
- Completed 'The Case of the Chronologically Confused Coffee Maker' or equivalent intro
- Basic understanding of TCD bureaucracy and factions

## Objectives
### Survive the Sector 7G Audit by Auditor Director Noctua.

**Success Conditions:**
- No major infractions discovered by Noctua
- Audit concludes without severe penalties for Sector 7G

**Failure Conditions:**
- Noctua finds evidence of significant rule-bending (use of unauthorized tech, forged forms, mission log discrepancies)
- Sector 7G placed on probation, budget slashed, Quill sanctioned
- Player character(s) singled out for disciplinary action

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Players successfully deflect Noctua's attention to another department
- Noctua seems unusually interested in specific 'minor' mission files (hinting at her secret investigation)
- Players manage to hide infractions but Noctua remains suspicious
### Gather Data on Recent Anomalies.

**Success Conditions:**
- Collect mission logs/data from at least 3 recent Sector 7G anomalies
- Identify a consistent pattern or signature linking them

**Failure Conditions:**
- Unable to access sufficient data due to audit lockdown or missing files
- Pattern remains elusive due to data corruption (faulty TCD systems)

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Data suggests deliberate interference (Paradox Purists/Agent Glitch)
- Pattern points towards locations related to Agent Veritas or 'The Glitch Incident'
### Access Restricted Information (Optional but Recommended).

**Success Conditions:**
- Gain access to relevant files/artifacts in the Anomaly Archive or restricted databases
- Find information correlating with the anomaly pattern (e.g., old project files, Veritas's case notes)

**Failure Conditions:**
- Caught accessing restricted areas/data, leading to severe consequences from Noctua
- Unable to bypass security or bureaucracy (Finnigan?)
- Required information is missing or heavily redacted

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Obtain information via Jax 'Sparky' Volkov's illicit network
- Trade favors with another department for access
- Find unexpected clues about TCD history unrelated to current pattern
### Analyze Findings and Report (Carefully) to Quill.

**Success Conditions:**
- Present a coherent analysis of the anomaly pattern to Quill
- Convince Quill the pattern is real and not Sector 7G's fault

**Failure Conditions:**
- Quill dismisses findings out of fear of attracting more attention
- Analysis is flawed, leading down wrong path
- Report intercepted by Noctua or Red Tape Brigade

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Quill reluctantly agrees to authorize further (discreet) investigation
- Analysis implicates another TCD department or high-level project
- Findings suggest a need for technology found only in dangerous locations like Continuum Caves or Era Ruins

## Key NPCs
- Bartholomew Quill
- Auditor Director Noctua
- Jax 'Sparky' Volkov
- Percival Finnigan
- Brenda Scrivens (for gossip about auditors/archive)
- Agent Glitch (potential interference)

## Key Locations
- Sector 7G
- Chronos HQ (Audit locations)
- Anomaly Archive
- Timestream Cafeteria
- Paradox Plaza
- Possibly Temporal Rift Valley or Epoch City for anomaly data

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Survival of Audit (maintaining Sector 7G budget/status); Identification of the anomaly pattern (major plot progression).
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Increased trust/reliance from Quill (if successful)
  - Favor owed by Volkov (if used for access)
  - Specific clue related to Veritas or Purists
  - Temporary access permit to a slightly less restricted Archive section (if handled well)
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - Blackmail material found during audit prep
  - Discovery of Noctua's potential secondary agenda
  - Location data for Era Ruins related to pattern
  - A 'lost' piece of slightly better gear hidden during audit panic
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Chrono-Auditors: -- Significant decrease if caught, slight increase if audit passed perfectly (unlikely)
  - Bartholomew Quill: ++ Increased trust if saved from audit fallout
  - Temporal Tinkers Guild: +/- Depends on reliance/favors
  - Red Tape Brigade: - Increased scrutiny if procedures bypassed

## Branching Paths
- Cooperate cautiously with Noctua if she shows interest vs. strictly obstruct/deceive
- Rely on official channels vs. illegal access for Archive info
- Focus investigation on Purist sabotage vs. Veritas legacy vs. TCD internal issue

## Optional Content
- Plant misleading evidence to frame another department during audit
- Help Volkov with a task in exchange for Archive bypass tools
- Interview long-term TCD staff via Brenda Scrivens about similar past incidents
- Run a 'clean-up' mission simultaneously with audit preparations
