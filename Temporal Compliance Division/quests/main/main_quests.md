# Quests

## The Case of the Chronologically Confused Coffee Maker
**Type:** main story quest
**Difficulty:** Low
**Estimated Duration:** 1-2 sessions

**Description:** Sector 7G's first 'major' assignment since the team's formation/arrival. A Class-2 Anachronism (a 1980s electric drip coffee maker) has materialized in a 15th Century Florence apothecary ('Epoch City' designation). Retrieve the item with minimal temporal disruption, file the necessary paperwork (Form 7-Alpha-TD-R), and try not to break your already glitchy equipment. Supervisor Quill is breathing down your necks.

**Prerequisites:**
- Character Creation
- Basic TCD Orientation (optional intro session)

**Objectives:**
### Obtain Mission Briefing and Equipment from Supervisor Quill.
**Success Conditions:**
- Receive briefing file
- Sign out standard issue (faulty) gear
**Failure Conditions:**
- Refuse assignment (highly inadvisable)
- Lose briefing file immediately
**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Quill gives slightly better gear if flattered/bribed with good coffee (unlikely)
- Gear immediately malfunctions upon issue
### Navigate Bureaucracy: Get Form 7-Alpha-TD-R (Temporal Deviation - Retrieval) counter-signed by Percival Finnigan.
**Success Conditions:**
- Finnigan signs the form without major delay

- Players perform minor, unrelated bureaucratic task for Finnigan to expedite signing
### Travel to Epoch City (15th Century Florence) via Temporal Portal.
**Success Conditions:**
- Arrive in the correct time and location
**Failure Conditions:**
- Portal malfunction deposits team slightly off-target (time or space)
- Portal temporarily destabilizes, requiring quick fix (possible help needed from Jax 'Sparky' Volkov remotely?)
**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Arrive during a major historical event (minor one, like a local festival), complicating stealth
### Locate and retrieve the anachronistic coffee maker from the apothecary.
**Success Conditions:**
- Coffee maker secured without alerting locals or causing paradoxes
- Minimal temporal contamination
**Failure Conditions:**

- Discover minor residue suggesting sabotage (early hint of Agent Glitch?)
### Return to Chronos HQ and file Post-Mission Reports (including Form 7-Alpha).
**Success Conditions:**
- Return successfully
- Forms filed correctly (enough) to satisfy Quill and Finnigan
**Failure Conditions:**
- Forms filed incorrectly, triggering reprimand/extra work

## Audit Anxiety & Anomaly Analysis
**Type:** main story quest
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 sessions

**Description:** Supervisor Quill is panicking: Auditor Director Noctua has announced a surprise audit of Sector 7G! Simultaneously, recent 'minor' anomaly reports show disturbing similarities - repeating energy signatures, locations tied to old TCD projects. Juggle hiding 7G's corner-cutting from Noctua while secretly investigating the anomaly pattern, possibly needing access to the restricted Anomaly Archive.

**Prerequisites:**
- Completed 'The Case of the Chronologically Confused Coffee Maker' or equivalent intro
- Basic understanding of TCD bureaucracy and factions

**Objectives:**
### Survive the Sector 7G Audit by Auditor Director Noctua.
**Success Conditions:**
- No major infractions discovered by Noctua
- Audit concludes without severe penalties for Sector 7G
**Failure Conditions:**
- Noctua finds evidence of significant rule-bending (use of unauthorized tech, forged forms, mission log discrepancies)
- Sector 7G placed on probation, budget slashed, Quill sanctioned
- Player character(s) singled out for disciplinary action
**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Players successfully deflect Noctua's attention to another department
- Noctua seems unusually interested in specific 'minor' mission files (hinting at her secret investigation)
- Players manage to hide infractions but Noctua remains suspicious
### Gather Data on Recent Anomalies.
**Success Conditions:**
- Collect mission logs/data from at least 3 recent Sector 7G anomalies
- Identify a consistent pattern or signature linking them
**Failure Conditions:**
- Unable to access sufficient data due to audit lockdown or missing files
- Pattern remains elusive due to data corruption (faulty TCD systems)
**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Data suggests deliberate interference (Paradox Purists/Agent Glitch)
- Pattern points towards locations related to Agent Veritas or 'The Glitch Incident'
### Access Restricted Information (Optional but Recommended).
**Success Conditions:**
- Gain access to relevant files/artifacts in the Anomaly Archive or restricted databases
- Find information correlating with the anomaly pattern (e.g., old project files, Veritas's case notes)
**Failure Conditions:**
- Caught accessing restricted areas/data, leading to severe consequences from Noctua
- Unable to bypass security or bureaucracy (Finnigan?)
- Required information is missing or heavily redacted
**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Obtain information via Jax 'Sparky' Volkov's illicit network
- Trade favors with another department for access
- Find unexpected clues about TCD history unrelated to current pattern
### Analyze Findings and Report (Carefully) to Quill.
**Success Conditions:**
- Present a coherent analysis of the anomaly pattern to Quill
- Convince Quill the pattern is real and not Sector 7G's fault
**Failure Conditions:**
- Quill dismisses findings out of fear of attracting more attention
- Analysis is flawed, leading down wrong path
- Report intercepted by Noctua or Red Tape Brigade
**Alternative Outcomes:**

  - Increased trust/reliance from Quill (if successful)
  - Favor owed by Volkov (if used for access)
  - Specific clue related to Veritas or Purists
  - Temporary access permit to a slightly less restricted Archive section (if handled well)
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - Blackmail material found during audit prep
  - Discovery of Noctua's potential secondary agenda
  - Location data for Era Ruins related to pattern
  - A 'lost' piece of slightly better gear hidden during audit panic
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Chrono-Auditors: -- Significant decrease if caught, slight increase if audit passed perfectly (unlikely)
  - Bartholomew Quill: ++ Increased trust if saved from audit fallout
  - Temporal Tinkers Guild: +/- Depends on reliance/favors
  - Red Tape Brigade: - Increased scrutiny if procedures bypassed

**Branching Paths:**

- Run a 'clean-up' mission simultaneously with audit preparations
## Veritas Vector or Purist Purge?
**Type:** main story quest
**Difficulty:** High
**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 sessions

**Description:** The anomaly pattern is undeniable, pointing towards either the hidden legacy of Agent Veritas or the escalating actions of the Paradox Purists under Agent Glitch. Leads suggest a critical location - perhaps Veritas's rumored cache in the Continuum Caves, a Purist staging ground in an Era Ruin, or a nexus point in a Temporal Rift Valley. Players must investigate the source, confront the threat, and make a crucial choice: expose a potential TCD conspiracy using Veritas's findings, or focus solely on stopping the Purists, potentially breaking major regulations in the process. Compliance is now optional.

**Prerequisites:**
- Completed 'Audit Anxiety & Anomaly Analysis'
- Identified the anomaly pattern's likely source (Veritas or Purists)
- Established relationships with key NPCs (Quill, Noctua, Volkov)

**Objectives:**
### Infiltrate the Key Location (Continuum Caves, Era Ruin, Rift Valley etc.).
**Success Conditions:**
- Reach the central point of the location
- Overcome environmental hazards and/or Purist defenses
**Failure Conditions:**
- Team incapacitated or detected too early
- Location becomes unstable/collapses
- Key evidence destroyed before discovery
**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover the location is a trap set by Purists/Noctua
- Find unexpected allies or enemies within the location
- Location contains evidence implicating TCD leadership directly
### Uncover the Truth or Confront the Antagonist.
**Success Conditions:**
- Find Agent Veritas's cache/final message OR identify and locate the Purist leadership/master plan
- Understand the full nature and scope of the threat
**Failure Conditions:**
- Misinterpret findings, leading to wrong conclusion
- Antagonist escapes with critical item/information
- Cache/Plan reveals a threat too large to handle with current resources
**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Veritas is revealed to be alive and involved (ally or antagonist?)
- Purists' motives are unexpectedly sympathetic
- Noctua arrives, forcing a three-way confrontation
- The threat is revealed to be malfunctioning TCD tech from 'The Glitch Incident'
### Make a Critical Choice.
**Success Conditions:**
- Players commit to a course of action: Expose TCD via Veritas's info? Stop Purists directly (potentially violating rules)? Attempt to ally with one faction against another? Try to contain the situation quietly?
**Failure Conditions:**
- Indecision leads to worst outcome (e.g., Purist plan succeeds AND TCD covers up)
- Chosen action backfires spectacularly
**Alternative Outcomes:**
- A previously minor NPC (Quill?) makes a surprising intervention
- Players find a 'third option' not initially obvious (e.g., using temporal mechanics creatively)
### Execute the Chosen Plan / Survive the Fallout.
**Success Conditions:**
- Successfully neutralize the immediate threat according to chosen path
- Escape the TCD crackdown or manage the political fallout
- Achieve a campaign ending state (see Campaign Outline)
**Failure Conditions:**

**Rewards:**
- **Primary Reward:** Resolution of the main campaign storyline; Determining the fate of Sector 7G and potentially the TCD.
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Unique item/technology from Veritas's Cache or Purist arsenal
  - Significant reputation shift with surviving factions
  - Possible promotion (or termination papers)
  - A working temporal device (maybe?) if escaped
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - True identity of Agent Glitch revealed
  - Secret of 'The Glitch Incident' or Upper Echelon uncovered
  - Access codes to previously locked TCD systems
  - The mythical Perpetual Motion Memo (if location found during climax)
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Depends heavily on choices: +/- Massive shifts with Chrono-Auditors, Temporal Tinkers Guild, Paradox Purists (if interaction possible), TCD Establishment

**Branching Paths:**
- Ally with Noctua (if possible) vs. Oppose her
- Use Veritas's info to reform TCD vs. Use it to destroy/escape TCD
