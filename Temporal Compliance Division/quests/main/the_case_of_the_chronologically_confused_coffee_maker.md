# The Case of the Chronologically Confused Coffee Maker

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** main story quest
- **Difficulty:** Low
- **Estimated Duration:** 1-2 sessions

## Description
Sector 7G's first 'major' assignment since the team's formation/arrival. A Class-2 Anachronism (a 1980s electric drip coffee maker) has materialized in a 15th Century Florence apothecary ('Epoch City' designation). Retrieve the item with minimal temporal disruption, file the necessary paperwork (Form 7-Alpha-TD-R), and try not to break your already glitchy equipment. Supervisor Quill is breathing down your necks.

## Prerequisites
- Character Creation
- Basic TCD Orientation (optional intro session)

## Objectives
### Obtain Mission Briefing and Equipment from Supervisor Quill.

**Success Conditions:**
- Receive briefing file
- Sign out standard issue (faulty) gear

**Failure Conditions:**
- Refuse assignment (highly inadvisable)
- Lose briefing file immediately

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Quill gives slightly better gear if flattered/bribed with good coffee (unlikely)
- Gear immediately malfunctions upon issue
### Navigate Bureaucracy: Get Form 7-Alpha-TD-R (Temporal Deviation - Retrieval) counter-signed by Percival Finnigan.

**Success Conditions:**
- Finnigan signs the form without major delay

**Failure Conditions:**
- Form rejected due to procedural errors (incorrect ink color, wrong box ticked)
- Finnigan initiates a procedural review, causing significant delay

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Players forge signature (risky)
- Players find loophole in regulations to bypass Finnigan
- Players perform minor, unrelated bureaucratic task for Finnigan to expedite signing
### Travel to Epoch City (15th Century Florence) via Temporal Portal.

**Success Conditions:**
- Arrive in the correct time and location

**Failure Conditions:**
- Portal malfunction deposits team slightly off-target (time or space)
- Portal temporarily destabilizes, requiring quick fix (possible help needed from Jax 'Sparky' Volkov remotely?)

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Arrive during a major historical event (minor one, like a local festival), complicating stealth
### Locate and retrieve the anachronistic coffee maker from the apothecary.

**Success Conditions:**
- Coffee maker secured without alerting locals or causing paradoxes
- Minimal temporal contamination

**Failure Conditions:**
- Locals witness temporal technology
- Coffee maker damaged or causes minor paradox (e.g., briefly brews espresso)
- Team detained by local authorities

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Apothecary owner believes coffee maker is divine/demonic artifact
- Coffee maker stolen by local thief before arrival
- Discover minor residue suggesting sabotage (early hint of Agent Glitch?)
### Return to Chronos HQ and file Post-Mission Reports (including Form 7-Alpha).

**Success Conditions:**
- Return successfully
- Forms filed correctly (enough) to satisfy Quill and Finnigan

**Failure Conditions:**
- Forms filed incorrectly, triggering reprimand/extra work
- Anomaly detected in returned item requiring quarantine (more paperwork)
- Attract negative attention from Auditor Director Noctua due to mission complications

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Successfully hide minor mission complications
- Use mission report to subtly request better gear

## Key NPCs
- Bartholomew Quill
- Percival Finnigan
- Jax 'Sparky' Volkov (optional remote assistance)
- Brenda Scrivens (for gossip/reactions)

## Key Locations
- Sector 7G
- Chronos HQ (Bureaucracy Halls)
- Epoch City (15th Century Florence Apothecary)
- Timestream Cafeteria

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Probationary period passed (or first step towards it); Mission Quota contribution.
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Standard TCD Pay Voucher (redeemable for synth-rations)
  - One (1) 'Slightly Less Faulty' Temporal Scanner Battery (if lucky)
  - Minimal positive notation from Quill
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - Potential contact established with Jax 'Sparky' Volkov
  - Favor owed by/to Percival Finnigan (if task performed)
  - Gossip from Brenda Scrivens about the mission's minor ripples in HQ
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Compliance Crew (Sector 7G): + Slight Cohesion
  - Red Tape Brigade: - Slight Annoyance (or Neutral if perfect forms)
  - Bartholomew Quill: +/- Minimal change based on smoothness

## Branching Paths
- Focus on perfect procedure vs. efficient completion
- Reliance on official channels vs. seeking unofficial help (Volkov)
- Investigate minor sabotage hints vs. dismiss as faulty gear

## Optional Content
- Attempt to 'acquire' supplies from the Apothecary
- Interact with Florentine locals (risky)
- Visit Paradox Plaza to 'prepare' for the mission
- File a complaint about faulty equipment (likely ignored)
