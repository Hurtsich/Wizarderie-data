# Veritas Vector or Purist Purge?

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** main story quest
- **Difficulty:** High
- **Estimated Duration:** 3-4 sessions

## Description
The anomaly pattern is undeniable, pointing towards either the hidden legacy of Agent Veritas or the escalating actions of the Paradox Purists under Agent Glitch. Leads suggest a critical location - perhaps Veritas's rumored cache in the Continuum Caves, a Purist staging ground in an Era Ruin, or a nexus point in a Temporal Rift Valley. Players must investigate the source, confront the threat, and make a crucial choice: expose a potential TCD conspiracy using Veritas's findings, or focus solely on stopping the Purists, potentially breaking major regulations in the process. Compliance is now optional.

## Prerequisites
- Completed 'Audit Anxiety & Anomaly Analysis'
- Identified the anomaly pattern's likely source (Veritas or Purists)
- Established relationships with key NPCs (Quill, Noctua, Volkov)

## Objectives
### Infiltrate the Key Location (Continuum Caves, Era Ruin, Rift Valley etc.).

**Success Conditions:**
- Reach the central point of the location
- Overcome environmental hazards and/or Purist defenses

**Failure Conditions:**
- Team incapacitated or detected too early
- Location becomes unstable/collapses
- Key evidence destroyed before discovery

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover the location is a trap set by Purists/Noctua
- Find unexpected allies or enemies within the location
- Location contains evidence implicating TCD leadership directly
### Uncover the Truth or Confront the Antagonist.

**Success Conditions:**
- Find Agent Veritas's cache/final message OR identify and locate the Purist leadership/master plan
- Understand the full nature and scope of the threat

**Failure Conditions:**
- Misinterpret findings, leading to wrong conclusion
- Antagonist escapes with critical item/information
- Cache/Plan reveals a threat too large to handle with current resources

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Veritas is revealed to be alive and involved (ally or antagonist?)
- Purists' motives are unexpectedly sympathetic
- Noctua arrives, forcing a three-way confrontation
- The threat is revealed to be malfunctioning TCD tech from 'The Glitch Incident'
### Make a Critical Choice.

**Success Conditions:**
- Players commit to a course of action: Expose TCD via Veritas's info? Stop Purists directly (potentially violating rules)? Attempt to ally with one faction against another? Try to contain the situation quietly?

**Failure Conditions:**
- Indecision leads to worst outcome (e.g., Purist plan succeeds AND TCD covers up)
- Chosen action backfires spectacularly

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- A previously minor NPC (Quill?) makes a surprising intervention
- Players find a 'third option' not initially obvious (e.g., using temporal mechanics creatively)
### Execute the Chosen Plan / Survive the Fallout.

**Success Conditions:**
- Successfully neutralize the immediate threat according to chosen path
- Escape the TCD crackdown or manage the political fallout
- Achieve a campaign ending state (see Campaign Outline)

**Failure Conditions:**
- Player characters killed, captured, or lost in time
- Temporal catastrophe occurs
- TCD descends into chaos or becomes more oppressive
- Antagonist achieves their goal

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Partial success with significant unforeseen consequences
- Players become fugitives from the TCD
- Players inadvertently gain control of Sector 7G or more

## Key NPCs
- Bartholomew Quill
- Auditor Director Noctua
- Jax 'Sparky' Volkov
- Agent Glitch / Purist Leader
- Agent Veritas (potentially)
- Percival Finnigan (potential bureaucratic obstacle)
- Brenda Scrivens (final rumors/reactions)

## Key Locations
- Continuum Caves
- Era Ruins
- Temporal Rift Valley
- Chronos HQ (potential fallout/confrontation zones)
- Anomaly Archive (if Veritas cache hidden there)
- Paradox Plaza (for last-minute gear/info)

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Resolution of the main campaign storyline; Determining the fate of Sector 7G and potentially the TCD.
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Unique item/technology from Veritas's Cache or Purist arsenal
  - Significant reputation shift with surviving factions
  - Possible promotion (or termination papers)
  - A working temporal device (maybe?) if escaped
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - True identity of Agent Glitch revealed
  - Secret of 'The Glitch Incident' or Upper Echelon uncovered
  - Access codes to previously locked TCD systems
  - The mythical Perpetual Motion Memo (if location found during climax)
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Depends heavily on choices: +/- Massive shifts with Chrono-Auditors, Temporal Tinkers Guild, Paradox Purists (if interaction possible), TCD Establishment

## Branching Paths
- Ally with Noctua (if possible) vs. Oppose her
- Use Veritas's info to reform TCD vs. Use it to destroy/escape TCD
- Attempt capture of Purist leader vs. Elimination
- Sacrifice Sector 7G/Quill vs. Protect them

## Optional Content
- Activate ancient/dangerous tech in Continuum Caves/Era Ruins
- Send a final, anonymous tip to Brenda Scrivens
- Attempt to use Paradox Plaza's black market to influence the outcome
- Plant evidence framing Percival Finnigan for everything
