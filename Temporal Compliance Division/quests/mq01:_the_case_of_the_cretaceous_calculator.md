# MQ01: The Case of the Cretaceous Calculator

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** main story quest
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Estimated Duration:** 1 Session (2-3 hours)

## Description
Orientation is over. Supervisor Mallory assigns the team their first official Minor Infraction: retrieve a modern scientific calculator inexplicably dropped near a T-Rex nesting ground 66 million years ago. A supposedly simple snatch-and-grab to test basic competency and adherence to procedure.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of basic TCD orientation (implicit start of campaign)

## Objectives
### Receive briefing and equipment check-out.

**Success Conditions:**
- Attend briefing in Sector 7G
- Receive Standard Issue Anomaly Kit and Paradox Scanner (Model II)
- Note Supervisor Mallory's specific instructions regarding budget and report format.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Skipping the briefing
- Forgetting key equipment
- Annoying Supervisor Mallory excessively before leaving.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Quinn Sterling might warn about the scanner's 'quirks' if engaged.
- Mallory might add extra procedural steps if the team seems incompetent.
### Travel to Late Cretaceous Period via Temporal Induction Chamber.

**Success Conditions:**
- Successfully initiate temporal insertion.
- Arrive within acceptable parameters of the target Paradox Hotspot.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Significant temporal displacement error (arriving days off, miles away)
- Minor equipment malfunction during transit causes temporary disorientation or system glitch.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- A minor glitch might strand them briefly, requiring basic tech troubleshooting (guided by Quinn Sterling over comms).
- Arrive slightly off-target, requiring navigation through hazardous prehistoric environment.
### Locate and retrieve the anachronistic calculator.

**Success Conditions:**
- Use Paradox Scanner to locate the calculator.
- Retrieve the item without being detected by large fauna.
- Avoid causing additional anachronisms (leaving footprints, dropping gear).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Scanner malfunctions, requiring manual search.
- Attracting attention of a T-Rex or other large dinosaur.
- Losing or damaging the calculator.
- Leaving behind modern contaminants.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Scanner leads them on a wild goose chase due to malfunction.
- Calculator is partially damaged by wildlife, requiring careful handling.
- Find evidence of *another* minor, unrelated anachronism nearby (e.g., a discarded soda can - creates optional objective).
### Return to Chronos Tower and submit anomaly & report.

**Success Conditions:**
- Successfully initiate temporal recall.
- Deposit calculator in Hazardous Anomaly Storage (via Archive Annex procedures).
- File Mission Report Form 7-Alpha (MRF-7A) correctly and on time.
- Satisfy Supervisor Mallory during debriefing.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Recall malfunction causes delay or bumpy return.
- Incorrectly filing the MRF-7A.
- Exceeding Chroniton Fuel budget allowance.
- Mallory deems the report incomplete or procedures violated.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Mallory assigns extra paperwork drills for minor errors.
- Quinn Sterling requests detailed feedback on scanner performance.
- Bob Jenkins offers cynical commentary on the mission's pointlessness.

## Key NPCs
- Supervisor Mallory Vance
- Quinn Sterling
- Bob Jenkins

## Key Locations
- Sector 7G (MIU Office)
- Temporal Induction Chamber
- Paradox Hotspots (Variable - Late Cretaceous)
- Archive Annex (for drop-off)

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Official completion of first mission, baseline TCD standing.
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Standard mission pay (Compliance Credits?)
  - Minimal Chroniton Fuel allocation for next mission.
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - If unrelated anachronism dealt with quietly: Small 'initiative' note in file (maybe positive leverage later).
  - Finding a usable part on the faulty scanner Quinn can use.
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - MIU: +1 (Baseline competence)
  - Supervisor Mallory Vance: +/- 0 (Met expectations) or -1 (Caused problems)

## Branching Paths
- Dealing with scanner malfunction (troubleshoot vs. manual search).
- Handling potential dinosaur encounters (stealth vs. distraction vs. panic).
- Reporting thoroughness (minimalist vs. detailed, potentially revealing issues).

## Optional Content
- Investigate and optionally retrieve the secondary minor anachronism (soda can).
- Attempt to scavenge useful flora/fauna samples (against regulations).
- Listen to Bob Jenkins' story about 'the time they sent Henderson back for a trilobite's misplaced monocle'.
