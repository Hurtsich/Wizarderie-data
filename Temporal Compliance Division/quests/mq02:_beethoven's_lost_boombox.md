# MQ02: Beethoven's Lost Boombox

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** main story quest
- **Difficulty:** Easy-Medium
- **Estimated Duration:** 1-2 Sessions (3-5 hours)

## Description
An early 1980s boombox is detected playing loud rock music in Vienna, 1805, disrupting Ludwig van Beethoven's work on his latest symphony. Retrieve the device before it unduly influences classical music history or causes a noise complaint paradox.

## Prerequisites
- MQ01: The Case of the Cretaceous Calculator

## Objectives
### Research historical context and receive briefing.

**Success Conditions:**
- Use Archive Annex resources to understand Vienna 1805 customs and Beethoven's known location/habits.
- Receive briefing from Supervisor Mallory, emphasizing minimal historical interaction.
- Confirm Temporal Induction Chamber calibration (Quinn Sterling assist).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Insufficient research leading to social blunders.
- Mallory adds stricter interaction protocols due to previous mission issues.
- Induction Chamber shows pre-transit instability warnings.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Beatrice Pettygrew provides overly detailed (or unhelpful) historical data.
- Rex Vance overhears briefing and makes condescending remarks about MIU handling 'noise complaints'.
### Travel to Vienna, 1805.

**Success Conditions:**
- Arrive at the Paradox Hotspot without significant temporal error.
- Successfully blend in with period-appropriate attire (low quality TCD issue).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Temporal Induction Chamber glitch causes arrival in wrong location or brief temporal duplication.
- Attire immediately draws suspicion.
- Arrive during a major unrelated historical event nearby.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Arrive slightly early/late, missing Beethoven's initial reaction but dealing with confused neighbours.
- Minor temporal duplication creates brief confusion/comedy.
### Locate and silence/retrieve the boombox.

**Success Conditions:**
- Pinpoint boombox location (likely near Beethoven's residence).
- Retrieve the boombox without lengthy interaction with historical figures (especially Beethoven).
- Silence the music source quickly.
- Avoid leaving modern traces.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Being witnessed directly handling the anachronism by Beethoven or other locals.
- Boombox is damaged and difficult to silence/transport.
- Accidentally causing a scene (e.g., tripping over a chamber pot).
- MED Agent Rex Vance arrives to 'observe' or 'assist' (interfere).

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Beethoven is intrigued/angered by the music, requiring distraction.
- Boombox batteries die just as players arrive.
- Need to acquire period-appropriate container to hide boombox.
- Rex Vance's interference complicates retrieval.
### Return, submit anomaly, and file reports.

**Success Conditions:**
- Successful recall to Chronos Tower.
- Deposit boombox in Archive Annex.
- File MRF-7A and potentially Interaction Report Addendum (IRA-2C) if historical figures were significantly encountered.
- Debrief with Mallory, justifying any deviations or interactions.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Report inconsistencies attract scrutiny.
- Mallory requires extensive justification for interactions or budget overruns.
- Evidence of MED interference complicates report.
- Negative report from Rex Vance (if encountered).

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Quinn Sterling is fascinated by the boombox tech.
- Successful mission despite MED interference earns grudging respect from Bob Jenkins.
- Minor reputation gain/loss with MED based on interaction with Rex Vance.

## Key NPCs
- Supervisor Mallory Vance
- Quinn Sterling
- Beatrice Pettygrew
- Rex Vance
- Bob Jenkins
- (Ludwig van Beethoven - Brief Interaction Target)

## Key Locations
- Sector 7G (MIU Office)
- Archive Annex
- Temporal Induction Chamber
- Paradox Hotspots (Variable - Vienna 1805)

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Successful anomaly cleanup, increased trust from Mallory (if smooth).
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Standard mission pay.
  - Slight increase in Chroniton Fuel allowance.
  - Access to slightly more detailed historical briefings from Archive Annex.
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - A 'souvenir' C-cassette tape from the boombox (minor forbidden item).
  - Observing Beethoven yields minor insight potentially useful for future cultural missions.
  - Finding a note dropped by Rex Vance revealing minor MED procedure/code.
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - MIU: +1
  - Supervisor Mallory Vance: +1 (if smooth) or -1 (if complex)
  - MED: -1 (if Rex Vance clash) or +/- 0
  - Archive Annex: +1 (if research done well)

## Branching Paths
- Approach to retrieval (stealth vs. distraction vs. direct approach).
- Handling Beethoven encounter (avoid vs. minimal interaction vs. accidental conversation).
- Dealing with Rex Vance (ignore vs. confront vs. cooperate reluctantly).

## Optional Content
- Attempt to decipher Beethoven's scribbled musical notes (if glimpsed).
- Explore a small section of 1805 Vienna (risk of contamination).
- Try to use the Requisition Hub Delta to get slightly better period clothing before leaving.
