# MQ03: The Curious Case of the Clockwork Courier

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** main story quest
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Estimated Duration:** 2 Sessions (4-6 hours)

## Description
A clockwork automaton, designed in the Victorian era but powered by a miniaturized fusion cell from the 23rd century, is delivering cryptic messages in 1888 London. Its existence is a minor paradox, but the messages hint at something deliberate. Investigate the source and purpose of the courier.

## Prerequisites
- MQ02: Beethoven's Lost Boombox

## Objectives
### Analyze anomaly report and receive briefing.

**Success Conditions:**
- Review initial anomaly data, noting the technological discrepancy.
- Attend briefing; Mallory emphasizes investigation *as well as* retrieval.
- Consult Quinn Sterling about the fusion cell signature - it might be faint/oddly familiar.
- Research Victorian automatons and courier routes in Archive Annex.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Dismissing the tech discrepancy as just another weird anachronism.
- Quinn cannot get a clear reading due to equipment limitations.
- Mallory imposes strict time/budget limits, hindering investigation.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Quinn recalls a similar faint signature from a previous minor incident report (buried file).
- Beatrice Pettygrew finds records of 'unusual clockwork sightings' from the era.
### Travel to London, 1888 and track the automaton.

**Success Conditions:**
- Arrive successfully in London.
- Use Paradox Scanner (upgraded slightly by Quinn?) and historical research to track the automaton's delivery route.
- Avoid drawing attention from Scotland Yard or suspicious locals.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Automaton moves erratically, making tracking difficult.
- Faulty scanner gives false positives.
- Team's presence/actions attract unwanted local attention.
- Temporal distortions near the automaton affect scanners.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Witness the automaton delivering a message to an unexpected recipient.
- Find a dropped component from the automaton (modern alloy?).
- Encounter Agent Silas Sterling (TID) conducting a 'routine temporal stability audit' nearby.
### Intercept a message and/or disable the automaton.

**Success Conditions:**
- Subtly intercept one of the automaton's messages.
- Successfully disable the automaton using appropriate tech/methods (EMP? Physical capture?).
- Retrieve the fusion cell and key clockwork components for analysis.
- Do so without significant public disturbance.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Message is destroyed during interception.
- Automaton self-destructs or causes significant damage when disabled.
- Interception/capture is witnessed, potentially by TID.
- Silas Sterling directly questions the team about their methods.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Message is coded or contains strange symbols.
- Automaton exhibits unexpected defensive capabilities.
- Silas Sterling offers cryptic 'advice' or warnings about procedural adherence.
- Capture reveals non-TCD tech modifications.
### Return, analyze findings, and report.

**Success Conditions:**
- Return with automaton components and message.
- Deliver components to Quinn Sterling for analysis.
- Submit detailed report including investigative findings and potential pattern.
- Survive debriefing with Mallory, possibly including input from Silas Sterling.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Analysis inconclusive due to damaged parts or encryption.
- Mallory dismisses investigative findings as conjecture.
- Silas Sterling files a negative observation report regarding team's methods.
- Report fails to highlight the suspicious nature of the anomaly.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Quinn confirms fusion cell signature is anomalous/matches previous incidents.
- Message hints at Chronosynclastic Syndicate activity or internal TCD codes.
- Mallory becomes more anxious about TID scrutiny.
- Silas Sterling's presence prompts increased caution/paranoia.

## Key NPCs
- Supervisor Mallory Vance
- Quinn Sterling
- Beatrice Pettygrew
- Agent Silas Sterling
- Bob Jenkins

## Key Locations
- Sector 7G (MIU Office)
- Archive Annex
- Temporal Induction Chamber
- Paradox Hotspots (Variable - London 1888)
- Quinn Sterling's Workshop (part of Sector 7G?)

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Successful containment of complex anomaly, first concrete clue of a larger pattern.
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Standard mission pay.
  - Increased trust from Quinn (if provided good data).
  - Mallory authorizes slightly more investigative leeway (if results justify it).
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - Deciphering part of the cryptic message reveals a potential contact/keyword ('Mr. Jones'?).
  - Finding a hidden compartment in the automaton with non-TCD data chip.
  - Silas Sterling leaves behind a regulation manual with specific paragraphs bookmarked - a warning or a clue?
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - MIU: +1
  - Supervisor Mallory Vance: +/- 0 (Concerned)
  - Quinn Sterling: +1
  - TID: -1 (Scrutiny Increased)

## Branching Paths
- Tracking method (observation vs. scanner focus vs. predicting route).
- Interception method (stealth vs. trap vs. direct assault).
- Dealing with Silas Sterling (cooperate fully vs. minimal info vs. obstruct subtly).
- Reporting findings (emphasize paradox vs. emphasize suspicion).

## Optional Content
- Investigate the recipients of the automaton's messages.
- Explore famous 1888 London locations (Whitechapel - carefully!).
- Ask Bob Jenkins about similar 'weird tech' incidents from the past.
- Try to get Quinn to bypass safety protocols for a scanner boost.
