# MQ04: The Elizabethan E-Reader

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** main story quest
- **Difficulty:** Medium-Hard
- **Estimated Duration:** 2 Sessions (5-7 hours)

## Description
An advanced e-reader containing the entire future works of Shakespeare (and several questionable fanfics) has surfaced in London, 1598. The immediate paradox is minor, but MED is claiming jurisdiction due to the 'cultural significance'. Retrieve the device while navigating inter-departmental politics and potentially uncovering who planted it.

## Prerequisites
- MQ03: The Curious Case of the Clockwork Courier

## Objectives
### Receive contentious briefing and prepare.

**Success Conditions:**
- Attend briefing where Mallory explains MED's interest and the pressure she's under.
- Receive conflicting directives (Retrieve quickly vs. Investigate source).
- Consult Quinn on disabling modern electronics discreetly.
- Consult Bob Jenkins for advice on dealing with MED interference.
- Requisition specific (but likely still faulty) gear for stealth/electronic suppression from Requisition Hub Delta.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Mallory forbids investigation due to MED pressure.
- Quinn lacks tools for discreet suppression.
- Bob Jenkins offers unhelpful or overly cynical advice.
- Requisition Hub Delta denies request for specialized gear.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Mallory gives subtle 'off-record' encouragement to investigate the source.
- Quinn suggests a risky field modification.
- Bob recalls a similar jurisdictional dispute that ended badly.
- Receive anonymous tip about e-reader's location (potentially from 'Mr. Jones' or internal source?).
### Travel to London, 1598 and locate the e-reader.

**Success Conditions:**
- Arrive in Elizabethan London.
- Locate the e-reader (possibly near the Globe Theatre or a known playwright hangout).
- Avoid attracting attention from locals or MED agents already on scene.
- Identify MED surveillance/containment measures.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Arrival is detected by MED temporal sensors.
- E-reader is actively being used or passed around.
- MED (led by Rex Vance?) confronts MIU team upon arrival.
- Location is heavily populated, making stealth difficult.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- E-reader has been slightly damaged, displaying corrupted text.
- Find evidence suggesting the e-reader was *swapped* for another item.
- Rex Vance offers a 'joint operation' (likely setting MIU up).
- Observe someone matching 'Mr. Jones'' description near the location.
### Retrieve the e-reader, potentially investigating its origin.

**Success Conditions:**
- Successfully retrieve the e-reader, bypassing or dealing with MED.
- Gather evidence about who possessed/dropped it (witness description, fingerprints, temporal residue).
- Disable device without causing a scene.
- Extract data log if possible (requires Quinn's help later).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Direct conflict with MED agents.
- E-reader is destroyed or confiscated by MED.
- Investigation alerts the original placer or Syndicate contact.
- Retrieval causes significant historical disturbance (e.g., brawl in a tavern).

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- MED interference inadvertently helps MIU secure the device.
- Find a hidden message or tracking device on the e-reader.
- Evidence points towards a disgruntled TCD employee or Syndicate activity.
- Negotiate a tense handover with Rex Vance, possibly conceding minor points.
### Return, navigate debriefing, and analyze.

**Success Conditions:**
- Return with e-reader and any gathered evidence.
- Submit report justifying actions, especially regarding MED.
- Provide e-reader to Quinn for analysis (data logs, origin tech signature).
- Survive debriefing with Mallory, potentially facing MED complaints.
- Present findings linking this to previous anomalies (Clockwork Courier signature?).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Mallory sides with MED due to pressure.
- Quinn cannot recover significant data from e-reader.
- Evidence is inconclusive or dismissed.
- Team faces formal reprimand or investigation due to MED conflict.
- Key evidence pointing to Syndicate/'Mr. Jones' is overlooked.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Quinn finds data fragments confirming deliberate placement and connection to previous case.
- Mallory discreetly supports the team against MED complaints if evidence is strong.
- Silas Sterling takes an interest in the inter-departmental conflict.
- Receive cryptic message acknowledging retrieval (from 'Mr. Jones'?).

## Key NPCs
- Supervisor Mallory Vance
- Quinn Sterling
- Bob Jenkins
- Rex Vance
- Agent Silas Sterling
- "Mr. Jones" (Potential Indirect Interaction)
- Beatrice Pettygrew
- Janice Pettygrew (if formal complaint filed)

## Key Locations
- Sector 7G (MIU Office)
- Temporal Induction Chamber
- Paradox Hotspots (Variable - London 1598)
- Requisition Hub Delta
- Archive Annex
- Compliance Auditorium (if formal hearing occurs)

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Successful retrieval under pressure, stronger evidence of coordinated temporal interference.
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Standard mission pay.
  - Significant increase in Mallory's trust/reliance (if handled well).
  - Leverage over Rex Vance/MED (if they messed up).
  - Access to Quinn's growing database of anomalous signatures.
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - Recovered fanfic provides humorous insight into future pop culture.
  - Finding non-TCD communication protocols on the device.
  - Anonymous 'thank you' gift of slightly better coffee appearing in Sector 7G.
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - MIU: +2 (Handled complex situation)
  - Supervisor Mallory Vance: +2 (Protected unit) or -2 (Caused major incident)
  - MED: -2 (Direct conflict/embarrassment) or +1 (Forced cooperation)
  - TID: +/- 0 or -1 (If rules overtly broken)
  - "Mr. Jones": +1 (Awareness/Interaction)

## Branching Paths
- Dealing with MED (avoidance vs. confrontation vs. negotiation vs. collaboration).
- Prioritizing retrieval vs. investigation.
- Following up on Syndicate/'Mr. Jones' hints (risky).
- Reporting findings (full disclosure vs. selective reporting to Mallory).

## Optional Content
- Try to attend a play at the Globe Theatre (briefly, carefully).
- Gather information from local tavern patrons about 'strange folk'.
- Plant misleading evidence to confuse MED.
- File a counter-complaint against Rex Vance via Janice Pettygrew in HR (bureaucratic nightmare).
