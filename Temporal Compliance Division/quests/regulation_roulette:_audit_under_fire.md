# Regulation Roulette: Audit Under Fire

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Main Story Quest
- **Difficulty:** High
- **Estimated Duration:** 2-3 Sessions (8-12 hours)

## Description
Internal Audit, led by the formidable Auditor Agnes Jenkins, has initiated a full performance review of your team, citing 'statistical anomalies' in your recent mission reports (possibly stemming from the Henderson Directive Debacle or Competitive Contamination Control). Simultaneously, a critical, rapidly escalating anomaly is detected near The Bermuda Temporal Triangle â€“ potentially linked to the Chroniton Cascade Theory. Henderson, desperate to keep Audit occupied and prevent them discovering the *real* problem, assigns you this dangerous mission, knowing Jenkins will insist on tagging along as an 'observer' to evaluate your adherence to procedure under pressure.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of 'The Henderson Directive Debacle' or similar
- Having attracted negative attention from Internal Audit

## Objectives
### Survive the joint mission briefing with Henderson (panicked) and Auditor Jenkins (icy).

**Success Conditions:**
- Receive mission parameters without revealing compromising information
- Endure Jenkins' preliminary audit questions
- Secure necessary (minimal) resources

**Failure Conditions:**
- Reveal incriminating information under questioning
- Jenkins blocks necessary resource allocation
- Henderson breaks down completely

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Jenkins adds specific procedural constraints to the mission
- Henderson slips you cryptic warnings or resources on the sly
### Travel towards The Bermuda Temporal Triangle with Auditor Jenkins observing every action.

**Success Conditions:**
- Execute TDU procedures flawlessly (or convincingly fake it)
- Handle inevitable TDU glitches while maintaining composure under Jenkins' scrutiny

**Failure Conditions:**
- Major TDU malfunction endangers the mission or Jenkins
- Procedural errors noted by Jenkins
- Lose equipment due to temporal turbulence

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Jenkins interferes with TDU operation citing regulations
- Temporal distortions provide unexpected cover or obstacles
### Investigate and contain the escalating anomaly in the volatile temporal environment near the Triangle, while adhering strictly to DTA regulations (as interpreted by Jenkins).

**Success Conditions:**
- Identify and contain the core anomaly
- Follow procedures to Jenkins' satisfaction
- Avoid becoming lost in the Triangle's distortions
- Prevent the anomaly from triggering a wider cascade

**Failure Conditions:**
- Fail to contain the anomaly
- Violate regulations, incurring Jenkins' wrath
- Anomaly escalates catastrophically
- Lose Auditor Jenkins in the temporal chaos (tempting, but problematic)

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover definitive proof of the Chroniton Cascade Theory
- Encounter Chronos Custodians facing the same threat
- Find wreckage/logs from lost DTA missions, including potential clues about the Phantom Agent
### Return to The Annex and face the post-mission audit debriefing with Jenkins.

**Success Conditions:**
- Successfully return
- Jenkins' audit finds no major actionable violations (or you have leverage)
- Anomaly contained
- Evidence of wider threat possibly secured discreetly

**Failure Conditions:**
- Mission failure leads to severe disciplinary action
- Jenkins finds major violations
- Evidence of Cascade Theory is confiscated by Audit
- Team is grounded or worse

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Jenkins is unexpectedly impressed by competence under pressure
- Jenkins focuses audit on Henderson's role
- Evidence gathered provides leverage against Audit/DTA leadership

## Key NPCs
- Arthur (Supervisor Henderson)
- Agnes Jenkins (Auditor)
- Gary 'Gaz' Higgins (Possible source for gear/technical help)

## Key Locations
- The Annex
- Supervisor Henderson's Office
- Temporal Relay Chamber
- Edge of The Bermuda Temporal Triangle
- Internal Audit Department Interview Room

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Surviving the mission and the audit: Team remains operational, possibly cleared of suspicion (for now).
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Unique data on temporal instability/Cascade Theory
  - Experience operating under extreme pressure/observation
  - Temporary respite from Audit scrutiny
  - Possible grudging respect from Jenkins (rare)
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - Leverage material against Auditor Jenkins or Henderson
  - Salvaged high-tech component from temporal wreckage
  - Map fragment leading deeper into the Bermuda Temporal Triangle
  - Gaz Higgins provides permanent equipment upgrade (minor) for helping him avoid Audit scrutiny
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Internal Audit Department: +/- Significant based on outcome
  - Supervisor Henderson: +/- Based on whether you protected him
  - Department of Temporal Adjustments (DTA): Neutral (Crisis averted/contained)
  - Chronos Custodians: +/- Possible encounter changes relationship

## Branching Paths
- Handling Jenkins: Strict Compliance vs. Subtle Rule-Bending vs. Malicious Compliance vs. Using Chaos as Cover.
- Anomaly Containment: Standard Procedures vs. Risky Innovation (justified by 'extreme circumstances') vs. Seeking Custodian help (if encountered).
- Cascade Evidence: Conceal vs. Reveal to Jenkins vs. Reveal to Henderson vs. Leak elsewhere.
- Post-Mission Debrief: Honesty vs. Obfuscation vs. Deflection vs. Using Leverage.

## Optional Content
- Attempt to run diagnostics on the Chroniton Cascade while Jenkins is distracted.
- Retrieve specific lost DTA artifact from the Triangle's edge.
- Plant evidence implicating the Chronos Custodians for the anomaly.
- Gather proof of Jenkins violating minor regulations herself during the mission.
