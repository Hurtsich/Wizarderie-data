# Cave Canem Chrononaut

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Faction Quest (Temporal Tinkers Guild) / Exploration Quest
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Estimated Duration:** 2 sessions

## Description
Jax 'Sparky' Volkov needs a specific component – a 'Flux Stabilizer Coil' from a defunct Chrono-Drill prototype – believed lost deep within the hazardous Continuum Caves beneath Chronos HQ. The Tinkers Guild will provide hazard pay (in useful salvage) and loan some slightly less glitchy cave-diving gear. Navigate treacherous discarded tech, unstable temporal fields, and potentially deactivated (or not-so-deactivated) TCD experiments to retrieve the coil.

## Prerequisites
- Established contact with Jax 'Sparky' Volkov
- Access to basic TCD gear

## Objectives
### Receive briefing and specialized gear from Jax 'Sparky' Volkov.

**Success Conditions:**
- Obtain mission details (last known drill location)
- Receive loaner gear (environmental suits, enhanced scanners)

**Failure Conditions:**
- Refuse the dangerous mission
- Loaner gear shows immediate signs of critical malfunction

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Negotiate for better hazard pay upfront
- Volkov provides cryptic warnings about specific hazards based on Guild rumors
### Navigate the Continuum Caves to the Chrono-Drill wreckage.

**Success Conditions:**
- Reach the target location
- Avoid or overcome hazards (unstable fields, collapsing tech piles, malfunctioning security bots, minor paradox creatures)

**Failure Conditions:**
- Team becomes lost or trapped
- Suffer critical equipment failure
- Take heavy damage from hazards

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover a hidden Tinkers Guild cache/outpost
- Find remnants of another, unknown temporal agency's tech
- Encounter evidence of recent Paradox Purist activity
### Extract the Flux Stabilizer Coil from the Chrono-Drill wreckage.

**Success Conditions:**
- Coil retrieved safely and intact

**Failure Conditions:**
- Coil damaged during extraction
- Activating the drill accidentally triggers a major temporal distortion or awakens dormant systems
- The coil is missing, already salvaged by someone else

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Find multiple valuable components alongside the coil
- Discover logs detailing the drill's experimental (and likely dangerous) purpose
- The 'coil' is guarded by a surprisingly resilient automated defense system
### Return the coil to Jax 'Sparky' Volkov.

**Success Conditions:**
- Coil delivered
- Receive promised reward

**Failure Conditions:**
- Return without the coil
- Attract Chrono-Auditor attention during egress
- Volkov disputes condition of coil or reward terms

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Trade extra salvage found for better reward from Volkov
- Report dangerous findings to Quill/Noctua (potential conflict with Volkov/Guild)
- Keep the coil or other valuable salvage (damages Guild relationship)

## Key NPCs
- Jax 'Sparky' Volkov
- Bartholomew Quill (if mission requires unusual 'sign-out' forms)
- Auditor Director Noctua (potential random encounter if near monitored access points)

## Key Locations
- Continuum Caves
- Paradox Plaza (for briefing/reward)
- Sector 7G (for potentially justifying mission time)

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Significant favor owed by Jax 'Sparky' Volkov; A selection of high-quality salvage/components useful for gear upgrades.
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Detailed (if slightly inaccurate) map of explored cave section
  - Loaner gear permission extended or gifted
  - Increased standing within the Temporal Tinkers Guild
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - A unique piece of experimental tech found near the drill
  - Coordinates to another promising salvage site
  - Information about Paradox Purist movements if encountered
  - Volkov's 'premium' repair service discount
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Temporal Tinkers Guild: ++ Significant positive boost
  - Chrono-Auditors: - Potential negative if activity detected
  - Bartholomew Quill: ? Neutral if unaware, Negative if causes trouble

## Branching Paths
- Prioritize speed vs. Thorough exploration/salvaging
- Report findings officially vs. Keep secrets for Guild/personal gain
- Deal honestly with Volkov vs. Attempting to leverage extra finds

## Optional Content
- Attempt to reactivate other pieces of defunct technology found in the caves
- Collect samples of paradox residue for analysis
- Map escape routes connecting Continuum Caves to other parts of Chronos HQ
- Leave Tinkers Guild markings to help future scavengers
