# Gastronomic Glitch

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Side Quest / Investigation
- **Difficulty:** Low to Medium
- **Estimated Duration:** 1-2 sessions

## Description
The Timestream Cafeteria is in crisis! The food synthesizers are malfunctioning, dispensing dishes like 'Spaghetti Carbonara with Live Trilobites' and 'Chrono-Loaf that actively resists consumption'. Brenda Scrivens is overwhelmed. Investigate the cause â€“ is it standard equipment decay, a crossed wire with the Anomaly Archive's containment field, sabotage by a disgruntled agent (or Agent Glitch?), or did someone try to synthesize 'authentic' period food using a corrupted file?

## Prerequisites
- Access to Chronos HQ
- Ability to interact with TCD staff

## Objectives
### Speak with Brenda Scrivens to understand the problem.

**Success Conditions:**
- Get details on malfunction onset, specific weird outputs
- Brenda agrees to let players investigate (unofficially)

**Failure Conditions:**
- Brenda refuses access, citing regulations
- Unable to get coherent information amidst the chaos

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Brenda provides gossip about potential culprits or recent strange occurrences
- Receive a sample of malfunctioning food (possibly hazardous)
### Investigate the Cafeteria Synthesizers and Control Systems.

**Success Conditions:**
- Identify the source of the malfunction (e.g., faulty component, software glitch, external interference)

**Failure Conditions:**
- Investigation triggers further malfunction
- Unable to access control panels without authorization (Percival Finnigan involved?)
- Source appears to be non-technical (temporal contamination?)

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Find evidence of tampering (cut wires, Paradox Purist symbol graffiti)
- Trace glitch to power fluctuations from nearby Anomaly Archive
- Discover logs showing unauthorized recipe uploads
### Rectify the Malfunction.

**Success Conditions:**
- Synthesizers return to producing 'normal' TCD rations (i.e., reliably bland)
- Cause of malfunction addressed (repair, remove interference, purge corrupted file)

**Failure Conditions:**
- Attempted fix makes the problem worse (e.g., synthesizers only produce nutrient paste)
- Solution requires a rare part or technical skill beyond the players (need Jax 'Sparky' Volkov?)
- Fixing the glitch causes a minor, temporary paradox

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover the 'glitch' was producing potentially valuable/useful substances alongside bad food
- Need to temporarily reroute power from another sector (angering someone)
- Bypass requires navigating TCD regulations via Finnigan
### Report findings to Brenda (and possibly Quill).

**Success Conditions:**
- Brenda is satisfied, cafeteria returns to normal
- File minimal necessary report with Quill (if required)

**Failure Conditions:**
- Report implicates players in causing further issues
- Findings necessitate official investigation, drawing unwanted attention

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Downplay findings of sabotage/external factors to avoid bureaucracy
- Brenda offers 'free' Chrono-loaf for a week as thanks
- Jax Volkov offers discount if his help was needed and handled discreetly

## Key NPCs
- Brenda Scrivens
- Jax 'Sparky' Volkov (optional assistance)
- Percival Finnigan (potential bureaucratic hurdle)
- Bartholomew Quill (for reporting)
- Agent Glitch (potential hidden culprit)

## Key Locations
- Timestream Cafeteria
- Chronos HQ (Maintenance Tunnels/Control Rooms)
- Possibly Anomaly Archive vicinity
- Paradox Plaza (if needing Volkov's help)

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Increased positive reputation with Brenda Scrivens and Cafeteria regulars; Cafeteria returns to 'normal' function.
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Favor owed by Brenda (good for future gossip/minor help)
  - Small TCD commendation chit (if reported successfully)
  - Discount from Volkov if his help was used discreetly
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - The 'true' (and horrifying) recipe file for Chrono-loaf
  - Evidence of Paradox Purist activity within HQ
  - Access code to a minor environmental control system
  - A stash of relatively palatable snacks Brenda had hidden
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Timestream Cafeteria Gossip Network: ++ Heroes of the Cafeteria
  - Temporal Tinkers Guild: +/- Depends on Volkov interaction
  - Red Tape Brigade: - If procedures bypassed
  - Paradox Purists: ? Possible reveal of their presence

## Branching Paths
- Technical fix vs. Blaming external factors
- Involve Volkov vs. Attempt fix alone
- Report sabotage vs. Cover it up
- Exploit malfunction vs. Restore normal function

## Optional Content
- Analyze the weird food outputs for useful components
- Interview cafeteria patrons for comedic witness accounts
- Try to 'hack' a synthesizer to produce actually good food (highly risky)
- File an official complaint about TCD food quality standards (futile)
