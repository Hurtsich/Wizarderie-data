## Stapler Seeking Shenanigans
**Type:** Side Quest / Personal Quest (NPC Related)
**Difficulty:** Low
**Estimated Duration:** 1 session

**Description:** Percival Finnigan from the Red Tape Brigade has lost his prized antique stapler, a Swingline 'Temporal Timeliner 5000' (a mundane stapler he's given a ridiculous name). While officially beneath TCD notice, Finnigan is subtly offering a 'procedural expediency voucher' (i.e., he'll look the other way on one minor form error) for its discreet return. Investigate its disappearance within Chronos HQ – was it misplaced, stolen by an office rival, or victim of a minor spatial distortion?

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic familiarity with Chronos HQ
- Interaction with Percival Finnigan (optional but helpful)

**Objectives:**
### Discreetly accept the task from Percival Finnigan.
**Success Conditions:**
- Agree to find the stapler without broadcasting the request
**Failure Conditions:**
- Loudly announce the quest, embarrassing Finnigan
- Refuse the task
**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Try to extort a better reward (Finnigan likely refuses)
- Finnigan provides vague clues about potential suspects/locations
### Investigate potential locations/suspects for the missing stapler.
**Success Conditions:**
- Gather clues pointing to the stapler's location (e.g., witness accounts from Brenda Scrivens, security log glitches, rival bureaucrat's messy desk)
**Failure Conditions:**
- Investigation attracts unwanted attention (Quill wonders why agents are stapler-hunting)
- Clues lead to a dead end
**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Find evidence of minor temporal disturbance near Finnigan's desk
- A rival bureaucrat admits to 'borrowing' it and demands a favour for its return
- Brenda Scrivens saw a maintenance bot carry it off towards Continuum Caves service access
### Retrieve Percival Finnigan's antique stapler.
**Success Conditions:**
- Stapler recovered intact
**Failure Conditions:**
- Stapler is damaged or destroyed
- Stapler is found but retrieving it causes a minor incident (e.g., argument with rival, activating faulty maintenance bot)
**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Find the stapler in an unexpected place (e.g., partially phased into a wall, inside the Chrono-loaf dispenser)
- Discover something incriminating alongside the stapler (e.g., rival's stash of pilfered office supplies)
### Return the stapler to Finnigan.
**Success Conditions:**
- Stapler returned discreetly
- Finnigan provides the promised 'voucher'
**Failure Conditions:**
- Return the stapler publicly, undermining Finnigan's authority
- Return a damaged stapler (voucher withheld)
- Lose the stapler again
**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Use information found with the stapler to blackmail the rival bureaucrat (or Finnigan himself?)
- Finnigan offers a slightly better favour if handled exceptionally well

**Key NPCs:**
- Percival Finnigan
- Brenda Scrivens (potential witness)
- Bartholomew Quill (potential complication)
- Unnamed Rival Bureaucrat (optional)

**Key Locations:**
- Chronos HQ (Bureaucracy Halls, Finnigan's cubicle area)
- Timestream Cafeteria
- Possibly near Continuum Caves entrance or Anomaly Archive depending on clues

**Rewards:**
- **Primary Reward:** One (1) 'Procedural Expediency Voucher' from Percival Finnigan (good for ignoring one minor form error).
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Slight positive reputation shift with Finnigan (meaning slightly less obstruction)
  - Amusing office gossip from Brenda Scrivens about the incident
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - Leverage/blackmail material on a rival bureaucrat (if found)
  - Map scrap showing a shortcut through the administrative levels
  - Finnigan's grudging respect (expressed as slightly less condescending tone)
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Red Tape Brigade: + Slight (Finnigan only)
  - Timestream Cafeteria Gossip Network: + Amusing Story

**Branching Paths:**
- Solve by investigation vs. Negotiation with rival vs. Minor 'burglary'
- Use findings for personal gain (blackmail) vs. Simple return
- Frame someone else for the theft (risky)

**Optional Content:**
- Perform a detailed 'temporal residue' scan on Finnigan's desk (likely fruitless but funny)
- Try to requisition an official 'Lost Item' form (guaranteed bureaucratic nightmare)
- Leave an anonymous note for the rival bureaucrat

## Gastronomic Glitch
**Type:** Side Quest / Investigation
**Difficulty:** Low to Medium
**Estimated Duration:** 1-2 sessions

**Description:** The Timestream Cafeteria is in crisis! The food synthesizers are malfunctioning, dispensing dishes like 'Spaghetti Carbonara with Live Trilobites' and 'Chrono-Loaf that actively resists consumption'. Brenda Scrivens is overwhelmed. Investigate the cause – is it standard equipment decay, a crossed wire with the Anomaly Archive's containment field, sabotage by a disgruntled agent (or Agent Glitch?), or did someone try to synthesize 'authentic' period food using a corrupted file?

**Prerequisites:**
- Access to Chronos HQ
- Ability to interact with TCD staff

**Objectives:**
### Speak with Brenda Scrivens to understand the problem.
**Success Conditions:**
- Get details on malfunction onset, specific weird outputs
- Brenda agrees to let players investigate (unofficially)
**Failure Conditions:**
- Brenda refuses access, citing regulations
- Unable to get coherent information amidst the chaos
**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Brenda provides gossip about potential culprits or recent strange occurrences
- Receive a sample of malfunctioning food (possibly hazardous)
### Investigate the Cafeteria Synthesizers and Control Systems.
**Success Conditions:**
- Identify the source of the malfunction (e.g., faulty component, software glitch, external interference)
**Failure Conditions:**
- Investigation triggers further malfunction

- Source appears to be non-technical (temporal contamination?)
**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Find evidence of tampering (cut wires, Paradox Purist symbol graffiti)
- Trace glitch to power fluctuations from nearby Anomaly Archive
- Discover logs showing unauthorized recipe uploads
### Rectify the Malfunction.
**Success Conditions:**
- Synthesizers return to producing 'normal' TCD rations (i.e., reliably bland)
- Cause of malfunction addressed (repair, remove interference, purge corrupted file)
**Failure Conditions:**
- Attempted fix makes the problem worse (e.g., synthesizers only produce nutrient paste)
- Solution requires a rare part or technical skill beyond the players (need Jax 'Sparky' Volkov?)
- Fixing the glitch causes a minor, temporary paradox
**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover the 'glitch' was producing potentially valuable/useful substances alongside bad food
- Need to temporarily reroute power from another sector (angering someone)
- Bypass requires navigating TCD regulations via Finnigan
### Report findings to Brenda (and possibly Quill).
**Success Conditions:**
- Brenda is satisfied, cafeteria returns to normal
- File minimal necessary report with Quill (if required)

- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Timestream Cafeteria Gossip Network: ++ Heroes of the Cafeteria
  - Temporal Tinkers Guild: +/- Depends on Volkov interaction
  - Red Tape Brigade: - If procedures bypassed
  - Paradox Purists: ? Possible reveal of their presence

**Branching Paths:**
- Technical fix vs. Blaming external factors
- Involve Volkov vs. Attempt fix alone
