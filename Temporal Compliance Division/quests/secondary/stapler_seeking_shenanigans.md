# Stapler Seeking Shenanigans

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Side Quest / Personal Quest (NPC Related)
- **Difficulty:** Low
- **Estimated Duration:** 1 session

## Description
Percival Finnigan from the Red Tape Brigade has lost his prized antique stapler, a Swingline 'Temporal Timeliner 5000' (a mundane stapler he's given a ridiculous name). While officially beneath TCD notice, Finnigan is subtly offering a 'procedural expediency voucher' (i.e., he'll look the other way on one minor form error) for its discreet return. Investigate its disappearance within Chronos HQ â€“ was it misplaced, stolen by an office rival, or victim of a minor spatial distortion?

## Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with Chronos HQ
- Interaction with Percival Finnigan (optional but helpful)

## Objectives
### Discreetly accept the task from Percival Finnigan.

**Success Conditions:**
- Agree to find the stapler without broadcasting the request

**Failure Conditions:**
- Loudly announce the quest, embarrassing Finnigan
- Refuse the task

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Try to extort a better reward (Finnigan likely refuses)
- Finnigan provides vague clues about potential suspects/locations
### Investigate potential locations/suspects for the missing stapler.

**Success Conditions:**
- Gather clues pointing to the stapler's location (e.g., witness accounts from Brenda Scrivens, security log glitches, rival bureaucrat's messy desk)

**Failure Conditions:**
- Investigation attracts unwanted attention (Quill wonders why agents are stapler-hunting)
- Clues lead to a dead end

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Find evidence of minor temporal disturbance near Finnigan's desk
- A rival bureaucrat admits to 'borrowing' it and demands a favour for its return
- Brenda Scrivens saw a maintenance bot carry it off towards Continuum Caves service access
### Retrieve Percival Finnigan's antique stapler.

**Success Conditions:**
- Stapler recovered intact

**Failure Conditions:**
- Stapler is damaged or destroyed
- Stapler is found but retrieving it causes a minor incident (e.g., argument with rival, activating faulty maintenance bot)

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Find the stapler in an unexpected place (e.g., partially phased into a wall, inside the Chrono-loaf dispenser)
- Discover something incriminating alongside the stapler (e.g., rival's stash of pilfered office supplies)
### Return the stapler to Finnigan.

**Success Conditions:**
- Stapler returned discreetly
- Finnigan provides the promised 'voucher'

**Failure Conditions:**
- Return the stapler publicly, undermining Finnigan's authority
- Return a damaged stapler (voucher withheld)
- Lose the stapler again

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Use information found with the stapler to blackmail the rival bureaucrat (or Finnigan himself?)
- Finnigan offers a slightly better favour if handled exceptionally well

## Key NPCs
- Percival Finnigan
- Brenda Scrivens (potential witness)
- Bartholomew Quill (potential complication)
- Unnamed Rival Bureaucrat (optional)

## Key Locations
- Chronos HQ (Bureaucracy Halls, Finnigan's cubicle area)
- Timestream Cafeteria
- Possibly near Continuum Caves entrance or Anomaly Archive depending on clues

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** One (1) 'Procedural Expediency Voucher' from Percival Finnigan (good for ignoring one minor form error).
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Slight positive reputation shift with Finnigan (meaning slightly less obstruction)
  - Amusing office gossip from Brenda Scrivens about the incident
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - Leverage/blackmail material on a rival bureaucrat (if found)
  - Map scrap showing a shortcut through the administrative levels
  - Finnigan's grudging respect (expressed as slightly less condescending tone)
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Red Tape Brigade: + Slight (Finnigan only)
  - Timestream Cafeteria Gossip Network: + Amusing Story

## Branching Paths
- Solve by investigation vs. Negotiation with rival vs. Minor 'burglary'
- Use findings for personal gain (blackmail) vs. Simple return
- Frame someone else for the theft (risky)

## Optional Content
- Perform a detailed 'temporal residue' scan on Finnigan's desk (likely fruitless but funny)
- Try to requisition an official 'Lost Item' form (guaranteed bureaucratic nightmare)
- Leave an anonymous note for the rival bureaucrat
