# SQ01: Project Stapler Reclamation

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Side Quest / Faction Quest (MIU)
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Estimated Duration:** 1 Session (3-4 hours)

## Description
The infamous office stapler from 'The Stapler Incident', currently secured in Hazardous Anomaly Storage within the Archive Annex, is reportedly exhibiting minor temporal distortions. Fearing TID scrutiny if an official Anomaly Report is filed, Supervisor Mallory tasks the team with discreetly investigating, neutralizing any temporal effects, and reporting back *off the record*.

## Prerequisites
- MQ02: Beethoven's Lost Boombox

## Objectives
### Receive 'unofficial' briefing from Supervisor Mallory.

**Success Conditions:**
- Understand the extreme need for discretion.
- Note Mallory's specific fears regarding TID and the Stapler Incident.
- Receive any 'deniable assets' Mallory can spare (e.g., expired access key, vague verbal authorization).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Expressing reservations too loudly, attracting unwanted attention.
- Mallory loses her nerve and cancels the unofficial request.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Mallory provides slightly inaccurate details due to panic.
- Bob Jenkins overhears and offers cryptic (un)helpful advice about 'sleeping dogs'.
### Consult Quinn Sterling for technical assistance.

**Success Conditions:**
- Explain the situation discreetly to Quinn.
- Receive specialized (and likely experimental/unreliable) scanner or temporal dampener.
- Get advice on handling localized temporal distortions.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Quinn refuses due to risk/lack of official requisition.
- Equipment provided is barely functional or has dangerous side effects.
- Quinn demands future favors for the 'off-books' work.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Quinn is morbidly curious about the Stapler Incident and provides better gear.
- Quinn accidentally alerts Chloe Quinn, who becomes overly curious.
### Access Hazardous Anomaly Storage in Archive Annex.

**Success Conditions:**
- Navigate the Archive Annex without attracting Beatrice Pettygrew's attention.
- Bypass or override low-level security on the Hazardous Storage cage containing the stapler.
- Avoid leaving evidence of unauthorized access.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Beatrice Pettygrew detects the unauthorized access and reports it (or delays the team with procedures).
- Security systems trigger a minor alert.
- Encountering unexpected temporal phenomena near the storage area.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Find evidence of previous unofficial 'visits' to the storage cage.
- Beatrice can be distracted or persuaded if approached carefully (requires social skill / finding leverage).
### Scan and neutralize the stapler's temporal distortions.

**Success Conditions:**
- Use Quinn's tech to confirm and quantify the distortions.
- Successfully apply dampening field or other method to neutralize the effect.
- Contain the stapler securely.
- Avoid causing a larger temporal incident.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Equipment malfunctions, worsening the distortion.
- The stapler exhibits unexpected resistance or temporal effects (e.g., minor time jumps, localized gravity shifts).
- Neutralization process triggers a noticeable energy surge detectable outside the Annex.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Scan reveals the distortion isn't inherent to the stapler but caused by external influence (Syndicate probe? TCD experiment leak?).
- Find residual energy signature matching Clockwork Courier or E-Reader.
- The stapler temporarily duplicates.
### Report findings discreetly to Supervisor Mallory.

**Success Conditions:**
- Exit the Archive Annex undetected.
- Return any borrowed equipment to Quinn.
- Provide a verbal-only report to Mallory detailing findings and actions.
- Reassure Mallory the situation is handled without official trace.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Evidence of the activity is discovered by TID/Beatrice.
- Mallory panics upon hearing the details.
- Unable to confirm neutralization, leaving lingering doubt/risk.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Findings about external influence make Mallory even more paranoid.
- Successful handling earns significant (but deniable) gratitude from Mallory.
- Quinn demands detailed (and risky) data from the neutralization attempt.

## Key NPCs
- Supervisor Mallory Vance
- Quinn Sterling
- Beatrice Pettygrew
- Bob Jenkins
- Chloe Quinn

## Key Locations
- Sector 7G (MIU Office)
- Archive Annex
- Chronos Tower

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Increased (unofficial) trust and favor from Supervisor Mallory.
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Small stash of 'off-the-books' Compliance Credits from Mallory.
  - Quinn owes the team a minor favor (or vice versa).
  - Detailed knowledge about the original Stapler Incident (from Mallory's relief/panic).
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - A small, inert fragment of the stapler (useless but symbolic).
  - Data confirming anomalous energy signature connection to other incidents.
  - Leverage over Mallory due to her authorizing unofficial action.
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Supervisor Mallory Vance: +2 (Handled sensitive task)
  - Quinn Sterling: +/- 1 (Based on interaction)
  - Beatrice Pettygrew: -1 (If detected/annoyed)

## Branching Paths
- Method of accessing storage (stealth vs. distraction vs. social engineering Beatrice).
- Handling unexpected temporal effects (contain vs. simply report vs. risky counter-measure).
- Level of detail reported to Mallory (full truth vs. reassuring summary).
- Involving/Trusting Quinn fully.

## Optional Content
- Look for other 'acting up' anomalies in Hazardous Storage.
- Try to find the *full*, unredacted Stapler Incident report while in the Annex.
- Leave a humorous object (like a red swingline stapler) near the cage.
