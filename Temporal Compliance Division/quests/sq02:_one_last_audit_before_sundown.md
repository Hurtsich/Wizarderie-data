## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Side Quest / Personal Quest (Bob Jenkins)
- **Difficulty:** Easy / Bureaucracy Hell
- **Estimated Duration:** 1 Session (2-4 hours)

## Description
Bob Jenkins, nearing retirement, confides in the team. Due to a minor infraction flagged years ago by HR (Janice Pettygrew), he needs his *very next* mission report to be absolutely flawless to secure his full pension. He asks the team to 'assist' him on a simple anomaly retrieval (e.g., a garden gnome from the Peloponnesian War) to ensure every single protocol is followed perfectly, despite faulty gear.

- Making Bob more anxious.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
