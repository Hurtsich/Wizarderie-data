# SQ03: The Phantom Photocopier of Floor Five

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Side Quest / Investigation
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Estimated Duration:** 1 Session (2-3 hours)

## Description
Persistent rumors and glitchy maintenance logs point to a malfunctioning photocopier on the long-disused Floor 5 of Chronos Tower. It's reportedly making copies of documents from random departments and even different eras, all by itself. Investigate this low-priority internal anomaly before it escalates from 'quirk' to 'unauthorized information breach'.

## Prerequisites


## Objectives
### Gather information about the Phantom Photocopier.

**Success Conditions:**
- Collect rumors from MIU staff (Bob, Chloe).
- Review maintenance logs for Floor 5 (likely incomplete/corrupted).
- Get vague authorization from Mallory to perform a 'routine equipment check'.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Dismissing the rumors as nonsense.
- Unable to access relevant maintenance logs.
- Mallory forbids the investigation as waste of time.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Chloe Quinn shares a specific, weird detail she heard.
- Maintenance logs hint at previous failed repair attempts.
- Quinn Sterling provides theories (temporal leak, power surge, sentient copier - mostly joking).
### Explore the disused Floor 5 and locate the copier.

**Success Conditions:**
- Navigate the dusty, potentially unstable Floor 5.
- Locate the specific copier mentioned in rumors/logs.
- Observe the environment for clues (power fluctuations, temporal readings, old coffee stains).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Getting lost on Floor 5.
- Floor 5 environment presents minor hazards (flickering lights, unstable floor panels).
- Unable to find the correct copier among other derelict equipment.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Find strange graffiti or notes left by previous visitors.
- Encounter minor temporal pests (Chronovores?) attracted to energy fluctuations.
- Discover the floor was previously used by a defunct TCD department.
### Observe and diagnose the copier's malfunction.

**Success Conditions:**
- Witness the copier activating on its own.
- Analyze the documents it produces (random forms, historical texts, blank pages?).
- Use Paradox Scanner/tech tools to determine the cause (power issue, temporal leak, hardware fault, network glitch).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Copier remains inert during observation.
- Cause of malfunction is unclear.
- Scanner readings are inconclusive or affected by local interference.
- The produced documents seem sensitive, raising alarm.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Copier prints a document related to a player's secret or a current main case.
- Cause is mundane (short circuit) but with weird side effects.
- Cause is minor temporal leak connected to Archive Annex or Sublevel Omega.
- Chloe Quinn followed the team and accidentally 'fixes' it by unplugging/replugging.
### Resolve the issue and report.

**Success Conditions:**
- Implement a simple fix (unplug, minor repair, recommend decommissioning).
- If temporal, apply minor containment or report to appropriate channel (Quinn/Mallory).
- File a brief report closing the 'routine check' ticket.
- Prevent the issue from escalating.

**Failure Conditions:**
- 'Fix' makes the problem worse.
- Unable to resolve the issue, requiring escalation.
- Report attracts unwanted attention due to mentioning temporal leak/sensitive documents.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Resolution is unsatisfyingly mundane.
- Discovery of minor temporal leak leads to new questions/worries for Mallory.
- Quinn salvages interesting (if obsolete) parts from the copier.
- Team jokingly names the copier 'BOB' (Bureaucratic Output Bot).

## Key NPCs
- Supervisor Mallory Vance
- Quinn Sterling
- Bob Jenkins
- Chloe Quinn

## Key Locations
- Chronos Tower (Floor 5, Sector 7G)

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Successfully resolving a minor internal anomaly, mapping part of Chronos Tower.
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Minor Compliance Credits for closing maintenance ticket.
  - Favor from Quinn if useful tech data recovered.
  - Funny office anecdote.
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - A strangely printed document that serves as a clue for a future quest.
  - Finding a lost personal item belonging to a known NPC on Floor 5.
  - Access code or map fragment for another part of Chronos Tower found nearby.
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - MIU: +1 (Problem Solver)
  - Quinn Sterling: +1 (If tech related)

## Branching Paths
- Method of investigation (observation vs. technical scans vs. percussive maintenance).
- Handling discovery of sensitive documents (report vs. discreetly destroy vs. keep).
- Level of detail in final report.

## Optional Content
- Thoroughly explore Floor 5 for other secrets or hazards.
- Try to trace the network connection (if any) of the copier.
- Write a humorous 'obituary' for the copier if decommissioned.
