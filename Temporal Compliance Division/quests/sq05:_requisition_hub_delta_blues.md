# SQ05: Requisition Hub Delta Blues

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Side Quest / Resource Management
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Estimated Duration:** 1 Session (3-4 hours)

## Description
Just as the team preps for a critical (Main Quest?) mission, a key piece of unique equipment suffers catastrophic failure. Quinn Sterling identifies the *only* available replacement part is logged somewhere within the Requisition Hub Delta - TCD's notoriously bureaucratic and inefficient supply depot. Retrieve the part before the mission deployment window closes, navigating red tape, unhelpful clerks, and potential rivals.

## Prerequisites
- MQ01: The Case of the Cretaceous Calculator

## Objectives
### Identify critical need and initiate requisition.

**Success Conditions:**
- Quinn confirms part necessity and location within Hub Delta.
- File Emergency Requisition Form ER-99b (requires Mallory's panicked signature).
- Receive basic tracking number (likely already inaccurate).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Mallory refuses ER authorization due to past budget overruns.
- Form filed incorrectly, delaying process.
- Quinn cannot confirm exact part location within Hub Delta's chaotic inventory.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Quinn provides a schematic of the Hub Delta's known layout/departments.
- Bob Jenkins offers tips on navigating the Hub ('Bring coffee. Lots of coffee.')
- Mallory sets an extremely tight deadline.
### Navigate the Requisition Hub Delta environment.

**Success Conditions:**
- Gain entry to Hub Delta.
- Successfully navigate between different counters/departments (Receiving, Inventory Check, Signature Authorization, Parts Release).
- Avoid getting lost or stuck in queues for excessive periods.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Denied entry due to improper paperwork.
- Sent on wild goose chase between departments.
- Stuck behind other agents with equally urgent/complex requests.
- Hub Delta experiences a 'minor system migration', freezing all requests.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Encounter Rex Vance smoothly acquiring high-end MED gear.
- Find shortcuts or helpful (or obstructive) Hub Delta personnel.
- Witness the sheer scale of TCD's logistical nightmare.
### Locate and secure the required part.

**Success Conditions:**
- Track down the correct clerk/section holding the part.
- Provide correct paperwork and authorization.
- Persuade/cajole/bribe clerk to find and release the part.
- Verify part is correct and functional (or functional enough).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Part is logged but physically missing ('inventory shrinkage').
- Clerk demands additional forms or higher authorization.
- Another agent (MED?) attempts to claim the same part.
- Part is located but in a hazardous/inaccessible storage area.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Part is found, but is an older/slightly incompatible model requiring Quinn's modification.
- Clerk requires a favor in return (information, covering for their break).
- Find a cache of other useful 'lost' supplies nearby.
- Part requires navigating a physical warehouse section, not just counters.
### Return with part before mission deployment window.

**Success Conditions:**
- Exit Hub Delta with the correct part.
- Deliver part to Quinn Sterling with time remaining before mission deployment.
- Quinn confirms part usability.
- Mission proceeds as scheduled.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Returning after the deadline, mission is scrubbed/delayed (Mallory is furious).
- Part is incorrect or damaged beyond use.
- Quinn requires significant time to modify/install, impacting mission start.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Successful return earns gratitude from Quinn and relief from Mallory.
- Team develops reputation (good or bad) with Hub Delta staff.
- Experience provides insight into TCD resource allocation favouring MED.
