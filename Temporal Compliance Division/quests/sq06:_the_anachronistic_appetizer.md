# SQ06: The Anachronistic Appetizer

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Side Quest / Syndicate Hint
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Estimated Duration:** 1-2 Sessions (3-5 hours)

## Description
A routine scan detects low-grade futuristic food technology: a street vendor in 1920s Chicago is somehow selling synth-protein patties. While a low-priority anomaly, initial reports suggest the vendor acquired the tech from a shadowy figure. Investigate the source, retrieve the tech, and see if it connects to the rumored Chronosynclastic Syndicate.

## Prerequisites
- MQ03: The Curious Case of the Clockwork Courier

## Objectives
### Review anomaly report and receive briefing.

**Success Conditions:**
- Note the unusual nature of the tech (low-grade but definitely future).
- Receive briefing from Mallory (likely dismissive of investigative potential).
- Quinn provides basic analysis of the tech signature (possibly corrupted/masked).
- Research 1920s Chicago, speakeasies, and vendor locations.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Mallory restricts mission to simple retrieval only.
- Quinn cannot get clear signature data.
- Insufficient historical research.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Report mentions vendor seemed nervous/coerced.
- Signature has faint echoes of Clockwork Courier or E-Reader tech.
- Bob Jenkins warns about getting involved with 'off-book temporal traders'.
### Travel to Chicago, 1925 and locate the vendor.

**Success Conditions:**
- Arrive successfully in Prohibition-era Chicago.
- Locate the specific street vendor using scanner/research.
- Observe vendor and clientele without drawing attention.
- Blend in with period attire.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Temporal overshoot lands team near Al Capone's headquarters.
- Vendor has already moved or been shut down by local authorities.
- Team's appearance/behavior attracts gangsters or police.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Vendor is doing surprisingly good business.
- Observe a figure matching 'Mr. Jones'' nondescript description observing the vendor.
- Find discarded synth-patty wrappers with unusual symbols.
### Interview vendor and retrieve food synthesizer.

**Success Conditions:**
- Approach vendor discreetly.
- Convince/coerce vendor to explain where they got the synthesizer.
- Obtain a description of the supplier ('Mr. Jones'?).
- Retrieve the synthesizer tech without causing a major scene.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Vendor refuses to talk or gives false information.
- Synthesizer is booby-trapped or self-destructs.
- Interview attracts attention of local mobsters wondering about the 'new crew'.
- Supplier ('Mr. Jones'?) actively monitors the situation and interferes.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Vendor provides a specific meeting location/time for their supplier.
- Description of supplier matches 'Mr. Jones' or is deliberately misleading.
- Retrieve coded message or tracking device hidden within the synthesizer.
- A brief chase ensues if the vendor panics.
### Return, analyze tech, and report findings.

**Success Conditions:**
- Return with synthesizer and intel.
- Deliver tech to Quinn for analysis (confirm signature, look for origins/tracking).
- File report detailing vendor interview and supplier description.
- Highlight potential Syndicate/'Mr. Jones' connection to Mallory.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Quinn cannot bypass encryption or determine tech origin.
- Mallory dismisses Syndicate connection as speculation.
- Report lacks concrete evidence linking to larger pattern.
- Intel about supplier is a dead end.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Quinn confirms tech signature matches other incidents, strengthening Syndicate theory.
- Recovered message provides keyword or contact method for 'Mr. Jones'.
- Mallory reluctantly authorizes limited cross-referencing of 'Mr. Jones' description in TCD databases.
- Team gains minor notoriety among temporal black market info channels.

## Branching Paths
- Approach to vendor (friendly vs. intimidating vs. undercover).
- Handling potential mob attention.
- Pursuing supplier clues immediately (risky) vs. reporting back first.
- Level of detail shared with Mallory about Syndicate suspicions.

## Optional Content
- Sample a synth-patty.
- Visit a (relatively safe) speakeasy.
- Try to place bets on the 1925 World Series (violates regulations).
- Look for other minor anachronisms in the area.
