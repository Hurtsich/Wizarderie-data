# The Caffeine Conspiracy

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Side Quest (DTA Internal Politics)
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Estimated Duration:** 1 Session (2-3 hours)

## Description
Whispers echo through the DTA Break Room: Supervisor Henderson is hoarding *good* coffee. Fuelled by lukewarm sludge and desperation, a faction of disgruntled agents tasks the team with a vital mission â€“ investigate the persistent rumors of 'Henderson's Secret Coffee Stash'. Confirm its existence, discover its location (likely somewhere in or near Supervisor Henderson's Office), and ideally, 'liberate' a sample for the weary masses.

## Prerequisites
- Access to The Annex
- Experienced the Break Room coffee

## Objectives
### Accept the 'mission' from disgruntled agents in the Break Room.

**Success Conditions:**
- Agree to investigate
- Gather initial rumors and 'evidence' (mostly complaints)

**Failure Conditions:**
- Dismiss the agents
- Report the 'conspiracy' to Henderson

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Agents offer dubious 'intel' or useless 'spy gear' (e.g., a bent paperclip)
### Gather clues about the coffee stash's existence and location.

**Success Conditions:**
- Find evidence supporting the stash's existence (e.g., unusual requisitions, Henderson seen with a non-standard mug, overheard comments)
- Narrow down potential hiding spots

**Failure Conditions:**
- Find no credible evidence
- Alert Henderson to the investigation

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Clues point towards Beatrice Sharma or Gary Higgins having their own stashes
- Evidence suggests the coffee is merely 'less bad' instant coffee
### Infiltrate the suspected location (likely Supervisor Henderson's Office or adjacent storage) outside of office hours.

**Success Conditions:**
- Gain access undetected
- Search the area thoroughly

**Failure Conditions:**
- Get caught by Henderson, cleaning crew, or security drone
- Trigger an alert

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Find the office unexpectedly occupied
- Discover unrelated potentially sensitive information
### Locate Henderson's Secret Coffee Stash.

**Success Conditions:**
- Find the hidden coffee (beans, grounds, or pods)
- Confirm its quality (relative to DTA standards)

**Failure Conditions:**
- Stash does not exist
- Stash found is empty or contains standard DTA coffee
- Stash is booby-trapped (mildly, e.g., alert notification)

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Stash belongs to someone else (e.g., a previous occupant)
- Stash contains something other than coffee (e.g., emergency supply of antacids)
### Report findings (and optionally, provide a sample) to the Break Room agents.

**Success Conditions:**
- Share intel on the stash (existence, location, quality)
- Optionally deliver a small amount of coffee

**Failure Conditions:**
- Fail to report back
- Report false information
- Get caught sharing 'liberated' coffee

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Findings spark further DTA gossip or a new wave of rumors
- Agents attempt a larger 'heist' based on your intel

## Key NPCs
- Arthur (Supervisor Henderson) (Unaware Target)
- Fellow DTA Agents (Generic Quest Givers)

## Key Locations

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Increased standing/camaraderie with rank-and-file DTA agents.
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Favors owed by grateful colleagues (minor intel, covering for lateness)
  - A small sample of the 'good' coffee (if liberated)
  - Knowledge of Henderson's office layout/security quirks
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - Finding a key to a rarely used Annex closet
  - Discovering Henderson's personal log (mostly complaints)
  - Map of the best napping spots in The Annex

## Branching Paths
- Investigation Method: Questioning colleagues vs. Surveillance vs. Sneaking.
- Infiltration Timing: Late Night vs. Early Morning vs. During mandatory meeting.
- Outcome: Report findings only vs. Liberate a sample vs. Expose stash publicly (risky).

## Optional Content
- Plant evidence suggesting someone else raided the stash.
- Leave a 'calling card' for Henderson.
- Check if Beatrice Sharma or Gary Higgins have similar stashes.
- Start a rumor that Auditor Jenkins confiscated the coffee.
