# The Henderson Directive Debacle

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Main Story Quest
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Estimated Duration:** 2 Sessions (6-8 hours)

## Description
An old, vaguely worded memo from Henderson (The 'Henderson Directive' about 'proactive anomaly mitigation') has caused unforeseen ripples. Reports of escalating 'chroniton static' and minor paradox clusters are surfacing in areas agents visited under that directive years ago. Henderson, panicking, tasks you with 'discreetly investigating' one such cluster (e.g., related to the 'Great Stapler Incident of '88' aftermath) and 'normalizing' the situation without attracting attention, especially from Internal Audit. This requires digging into old mission logs in the Records Archive.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of 'Competitive Contamination Control' or similar mission
- Awareness of DTA's history of mishaps

## Objectives
### Receive panicked, vague instructions from Supervisor Henderson.

**Success Conditions:**
- Understand the (implied) goal: Fix the mess quietly
- Receive authorization to access relevant files (maybe)

**Failure Conditions:**
- Misinterpret the goal
- Henderson attracts attention while briefing
- Fail to get necessary clearance

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Henderson provides deliberately misleading information to cover his tracks
### Navigate the Records Archive and persuade Beatrice 'Bea' Sharma to grant access to old, possibly sensitive, mission files related to the Henderson Directive.

**Success Conditions:**
- Successfully retrieve relevant mission logs and reports
- Gain Bea's cooperation (or circumvent her objections)

**Failure Conditions:**
- Fail to find the correct files
- Antagonize Bea, leading to obstruction
- Bea reports your suspicious activity

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Bea provides cryptic clues or additional, unsolicited information
- Discover redacted or missing sections in the files
- Find mention of the Chroniton Cascade Theory
### Travel to the affected historical location/time period and investigate the paradox cluster.

**Success Conditions:**
- Identify the source of the escalating paradoxes (likely unintended consequences of past DTA actions)
- Map the extent of the temporal instability

**Failure Conditions:**
- Fail to identify the root cause
- Exacerbate the paradoxes through investigation
- Attract historical attention

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover evidence of Time Vandal exploitation of the instability
- Find lingering faulty DTA equipment causing issues
### Implement a solution to stabilize the paradox cluster without causing new major anomalies.

**Success Conditions:**
- Reduce Paradox Quotient and chroniton static to acceptable levels
- Solution is discreet and avoids official notice

**Failure Conditions:**
- Solution fails or backfires
- Solution requires noticeable temporal manipulation, attracting Audit
- Solution causes a new, different type of paradox

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Implement a temporary fix requiring future maintenance
- Solution involves ethically questionable methods (e.g., erasing a minor historical event/person)
### Report back to Henderson with plausible deniability.

**Success Conditions:**
- Convince Henderson the situation is resolved
- File sanitized report omitting sensitive details
- Avoid triggering an Internal Audit investigation

**Failure Conditions:**
- Fail to convince Henderson
- Report contains incriminating evidence
- Audit launches investigation based on temporal readings or Bea's report

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Henderson demands proof, requiring fabricated evidence
- Gain blackmail material on Henderson

## Key NPCs
- Arthur (Supervisor Henderson)
- Beatrice 'Bea' Sharma

## Key Locations
- The Annex
- Supervisor Henderson's Office
- Records Archive
- Affected Historical Site (e.g., 1988 Office Park linked to Stapler Incident)

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Stabilizing the paradox cluster: Prevents escalation, Henderson owes you (unofficially).
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Deeper understanding of DTA history/incompetence
  - Increased trust/leverage with Bea Sharma (if handled well)
  - Experience in dealing with complex paradoxes
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - Copy of a sensitive file from the Records Archive
  - First concrete clues about the Chroniton Cascade Theory's validity
  - Location of a hidden compartment in Henderson's office (empty, but suspicious)
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Supervisor Henderson: + Major (Problem Buried)
  - Beatrice Sharma: +/- based on interaction
  - Internal Audit Department: + Risk (Potential future scrutiny)
  - Department of Temporal Adjustments (DTA): Neutral (Problem handled off-books)

## Branching Paths
- Dealing with Bea: Respectful Procedure vs. Persuasion/Bribery vs. Deception/Stealth.
- Investigating the Cluster: Cautious Observation vs. Direct Intervention vs. Following Vandal leads.
- Stabilization Method: By-the-book fix vs. Risky Improvisation vs. Covering up vs. Minimal intervention.
- Reporting to Henderson: Full Disclosure (risky) vs. Sanitized Report vs. Using info as Leverage.

## Optional Content
- Cross-reference findings with rumors of the 'Phantom Agent of Sector Null'.
- Try to recover lost DTA equipment from the historical site.
- Investigate side-anomalies caused by the main cluster.
- Leave an anonymous tip for Auditor Jenkins about Henderson's Directive (high risk).
