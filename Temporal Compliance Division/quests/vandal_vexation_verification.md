# Vandal Vexation Verification

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Side Quest (Faction Encounter)
- **Difficulty:** Easy to Medium (depending on Vandal interaction)
- **Estimated Duration:** 1 Session (3-4 hours)

## Description
An alert flags a minor temporal distortion in Roman Market Anomaly Sector 7G - unusual energy signatures consistent with Temporal Vandal activity. Henderson dismisses it as 'probably faulty sensors' but assigns your team to 'verify sensor malfunction' (i.e., check it out cheaply). The mission is to confirm the anomaly source and, if it's Vandals, gather intel on their methods and tech, then disengage. Direct confrontation is discouraged unless unavoidable.

## Prerequisites
- Completed at least one mission to Roman Market Anomaly Sector 7G

## Objectives
### Receive the dismissive mission briefing from Supervisor Henderson.

**Success Conditions:**
- Understand the objective: Investigate cheaply, avoid trouble
- Receive coordinates for Sector 7G

**Failure Conditions:**
- Question Henderson's dismissal too much, raising suspicions
- Fail to get necessary TDU authorization

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Henderson provides faulty sensor readings as 'proof'
### Travel to Roman Market Anomaly Sector 7G and locate the source of the temporal distortion.

**Success Conditions:**
- Arrive discreetly
- Pinpoint the anomaly location using scanners (if working)

**Failure Conditions:**
- TDU malfunction alerts locals or Vandals
- Fail to locate the source before it dissipates

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Distortion is mobile, requiring tracking
- Anomaly interferes with scanners
### Observe the source: Confirm if Time Vandals are present and identify their activity.

**Success Conditions:**
- Identify Vandals (if present)
- Document their actions (e.g., leaving graffiti, running a minor scam, testing faulty tech)
- Gather data on their equipment/methods without being detected

**Failure Conditions:**
- Misidentify source
- Alert Vandals to your presence
- Unable to get clear observations

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Source is not Vandals, but a different minor temporal phenomenon (e.g., echo from past DTA mission)
- Vandals are unexpectedly well-equipped or organized
### Disengage and return to The Annex with gathered intelligence.

**Success Conditions:**
- Withdraw without confrontation
- Successfully return via TDU
- Secure collected data/observations

**Failure Conditions:**
- Forced into confrontation with Vandals
- Lose data during escape/return
- Return requires explaining unexpected equipment damage or paradoxical readings

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Retrieve a piece of abandoned/damaged Vandal tech
- Vandals leave a taunting message for the DTA
### File report confirming 'sensor malfunction' or detailing Vandal activity (as appropriate).

**Success Conditions:**
- Submit report that satisfies Henderson (likely downplaying Vandal threat unless unavoidable)
- Report provides useful intel on Vandal methods

**Failure Conditions:**
- Report triggers unwanted follow-up mission
- Report contradicts Henderson's initial assessment too strongly, causing friction
- Report attracts Audit scrutiny

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Report leads to updated DTA protocols regarding Vandal identification

## Key NPCs
- Arthur (Supervisor Henderson)
- Time Vandals (Generic)

## Key Locations
- The Annex
- Temporal Relay Chamber
- Roman Market Anomaly Sector 7G

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Updated intelligence on local Time Vandal activities and technology.
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Confirmation of sensor reliability (or lack thereof)
  - Minor BAU bonus if Vandal activity confirmed and reported tactfully
  - Experience in stealth/observation
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - A piece of salvaged Vandal tech (potentially useful or hazardous)
  - Map of known Vandal graffiti tags/locations
  - Frequency used by local Vandals for communication
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Time Vandals: +/- Minor (Awareness Increased/Potential Grudge)
  - Supervisor Henderson: +/- Based on report handling

## Branching Paths
- Investigation Approach: Remote Observation vs. Close Surveillance vs. Baiting.
- Encounter Handling (If detected): Immediate Retreat vs. Brief Skirmish vs. Attempted Communication/Intimidation.
- Reporting Strategy: Downplay Vandal Threat vs. Accurate Assessment vs. Exaggerate Threat (to justify future requisitions).

## Optional Content
- Attempt to disrupt the Vandals' activity non-violently.
- Leave a DTA 'warning' marker.
- Follow Vandals to their temporal exit point.
- Analyze recovered Vandal tech with Gary Higgins.
