# Temporal Compliance Division World Setting

## Description
A world setting for the 'Temporal Compliance Division' campaign. This world blends mundane office bureaucracy with low-stakes time travel. Players are agents of a chronically underfunded temporal agency, tasked with fixing minor timeline inconsistencies while navigating internal politics, malfunctioning equipment, and endless paperwork. The 'world' encompasses the agency's dilapidated headquarters, the chaotic Timestream, and various historical periods prone to minor anachronisms.

## Physical World
The 'physical world' is not a single planet but the interconnected web of timelines (the Timestream) and the pocket dimensions housing agency infrastructure. Chronos HQ exists slightly outside normal spacetime.

### Details
The Timestream is inherently unstable in places, creating 'Temporal Rift Valleys' prone to minor paradoxes. Agency headquarters (Chronos HQ) and equipment are often outdated, poorly maintained, and prone to glitches due to severe budget cuts following 'The Glitch Incident'. Energy fluctuations and unpredictable portal stability are common.

### Impact
The unstable nature of time travel and unreliable gear make even minor missions unpredictable. Navigating Chronos HQ itself can be hazardous, with flickering lights, spatial distortions in unused sectors, and the ever-present hum of failing temporal generators.

## Cultural Elements
The dominant culture is the corporate/bureaucratic environment of the Temporal Compliance Division (TCD). It's a culture defined by acronyms, regulations, and survival.

### Details
Key cultural elements include a unique jargon filled with temporal terminology and bureaucratic acronyms (e.g., 'Form 7-Alpha-Temporal Deviation Report'), mandatory 'Paradox Avoidance Training' (PAT) sessions (often used for office gossip), and traditions like the annual 'Least Disruptive Temporal Correction' award ceremony (a low-key event in the Timestream Cafeteria). Filing forms in triplicate for even minor temporal adjustments is standard practice.

### Impact
This culture fosters cynicism, rule-bending, and a focus on avoiding blame rather than efficient problem-solving. Agent morale is often low, driven by quotas and the fear of audits, but camaraderie exists in shared adversity against the system.

## Social Structures
A rigid hierarchical structure governs the TCD, characterized by clear divisions between field agents, middle management, internal affairs, and the rarely-seen leadership.

### Details
At the bottom are Field Agents (like the players in Sector 7G), overworked and under-resourced. Above them are Case Managers (like the Red Tape Brigade), focused on paperwork and metrics. The Chrono-Auditors represent Internal Affairs, feared for their power to censure or 'reassign'. At the top sits the mysterious 'Upper Echelon', whose directives filter down through layers of bureaucracy.

### Impact
This structure creates significant office politics, inter-departmental rivalries (especially for budget allocation), and hinders efficient operations. Advancement is slow and often based on navigating bureaucracy rather than mission success.

## Economic Systems
The TCD operates on a severely restricted budget, making resource scarcity a primary driver of conflict and agent behavior.

### Details
There's no traditional currency within the TCD; value lies in requisition approvals, access to slightly-less-broken equipment, favors owed, and information. Departments constantly fight over budget allocations. Scavenging parts from the Anomaly Archive or the Continuum Caves, or trading on the black market in Paradox Plaza, is common for underfunded sectors like 7G.

### Impact
The lack of resources directly impacts mission capabilities, forcing agents to improvise with faulty gear. It fuels the existence of factions like the Temporal Tinkers Guild and encourages unofficial bartering systems, often skirting official regulations.

## Locations
### Chronos HQ
The sprawling, poorly maintained headquarters of the Temporal Compliance Division, existing in a pocket dimension. It's a labyrinth of offices, labs, and containment facilities.

## Historical Events
### A catastrophic system-wide malfunction in Chronos HQ decades ago, caused by experimental tech or budget cuts (reports vary). It resulted in significant timeline damage (mostly repaired) and near-destruction of the TCD.
**Impact:** Led directly to the current era of extreme budget austerity, hypersensitivity to paradoxes, the empowerment of the Chrono-Auditors, and a pervasive institutional fear of technological failure and innovation.
### A complex set of inter-temporal treaties signed after disastrous conflicts between nascent temporal powers. The TCD was established (or reformed) under its restrictive mandate.
**Impact:** Strictly limits the TCD's remit to 'minor temporal hygiene', forbidding intervention in major historical events and creating layers of international (inter-temporal) regulations and bureaucracy.
### A highly competent, legendary field agent vanished without a trace while investigating a series of related minor paradoxes pointing to something bigger. Official report: 'Lost in Timestream Incident'.
**Impact:** Became a cautionary tale within the TCD, fueling paranoia and conspiracy theories about the dangers of looking too deep. Rumors of their survival or hidden legacy persist.

## Secrets and Legends
### A mythical bureaucratic form rumored to exist deep within the TCD's filing system. Properly completed and counter-signed, it allegedly grants unlimited resources or budget to the filer.
**Significance:** Represents the ultimate fantasy for resource-starved agents; chasing rumors of its existence can lead agents through the most absurd bureaucratic mazes.
### A heavily classified report detailing an incident where a TCD team became trapped in a localized, repeating time loop caused by faulty equipment or a paradox. Access is strictly forbidden.
**Significance:** A potential plot hook involving forbidden knowledge, the dangers of temporal phenomena, and the TCD's tendency to bury its mistakes. The report might contain clues to escape such a loop.
### Persistent rumors claim Agent Veritas hid incriminating evidence about a TCD conspiracy or powerful, forbidden temporal technology somewhere within Chronos HQ or a specific timeline before disappearing.
**Significance:** A potential major discovery for players, linking them to a larger underlying plot beyond routine anomaly cleanup. Could grant access to powerful but dangerous tech or information.
### The actual identity, goals, and even existence of the TCD's highest leadership are unknown to almost everyone. Directives arrive via impersonal memos or mid-level bureaucrats.
**Significance:** The ultimate source of the TCD's often illogical mandates and budget decisions. Are they incompetent, malevolent, alien, AI, or just mythical figures used by middle management?
