# Vessel Prime: Echoes of the Ark

## Campaign Description
You are inhabitants of a colossal, city-sized generation ship traveling between stars, but the "ship" is actually a kilometers-long, ancient, semi-sentient bio-mechanical organism. Strange ecological shifts, internal "mutations," and cryptic communications from the Ark itself drive the plot as you try to survive its biological imperatives.

## Campaign Theme
Survival and mystery aboard a colossal, living starship wrestling with its own biology and inscrutable consciousness.
