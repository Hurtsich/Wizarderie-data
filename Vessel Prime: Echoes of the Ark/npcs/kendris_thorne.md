  - Theron Bast: Respects, but keeps distance

## Development Potential
Could be hired by the players for protection or specific missions. Might be convinced to help against corrupt Sentinels if motivated correctly. Could become a reluctant ally.

Transactional and cynical. Impressed by competence and willingness to pay. Might offer gruff advice. Can be swayed to help causes he deems worthy, especially if it involves sticking it to corrupt Sentinels, but always for a price (or a very good reason).
