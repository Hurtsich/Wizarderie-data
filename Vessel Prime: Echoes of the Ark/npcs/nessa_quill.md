# Nessa Quill - Cryo-Pod Monitor

## Role
Supporting NPC - Sentinel assigned to the Cryo-Sleep Cenotaph

## Physical Description
Young Lumen Sentinel, looks perpetually cold and bored. Armor is standard issue but meticulously clean. Often paces nervously.

## Background
- **Origin:** Mid-level family with Sentinel connections, assigned to the Cenotaph as a 'safe' posting.
- **Significant Events:**
  - Witnessed strange energy fluctuations around certain pods.
  - Heard rumors about the Cryo-Thaw Incident survivors.
  - Feels isolated and unimportant.
- **Relationships:**
  - Lumen Sentinels: Guard Duty
  - Theron Bast: Distant Respect
- **Secrets:**
  - Keeps an unauthorized log of anomalies she's witnessed.
  - Sometimes lets scavengers slip by certain areas for small bribes (food, luxuries).
  - Found a small, inert data chip near an empty pod.

## Personality
- **Traits:**
  - Bored
  - Lonely
  - Slightly Corruptible
  - Observant (when not bored)
- **Values:**
  - Duty (mostly)
  - Personal Comfort
  - Routine
- **Fears:**
  - Something activating in the pods
  - Being reassigned to a combat zone
  - Her superiors finding her log or bribe-taking
- **Desires:**
  - A transfer to a more populated area
  - Something interesting to happen (but not too dangerous)

## Motivations
- Doing her job (enough to not get in trouble).
- Alleviating boredom.
- Personal safety.

## Goals
- Complete her shifts without incident.
- Gather minor perks through bribes.
- Maybe eventually report anomalies if they get scary enough.

## Connections
- Lumen Sentinels: Member
- Cryo-Sleep Cenotaph: Duty Station

## Development Potential
Could be a source of information about the Cenotaph or Sentinel activity there. Might help players access restricted areas out of boredom or for a price. Could become braver if faced with real danger.

## Reaction to Players
Indifferent unless they cause trouble or offer something interesting (bribes, news, gossip). Might bend rules if the risk seems low and the reward worthwhile. Suspicious of anyone showing too much interest in the pods.
