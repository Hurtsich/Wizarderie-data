# Seraphina Koss - High Cultivator

## Role
Major Antagonist - Leader of the Veridian Cultivators

## Physical Description
Appears deceptively serene and matronly, with smooth features and hair woven with living vines. Always wears pristine green and white robes. Her eyes are cold and calculating. Often seen tending to a rare, perfectly cultivated bloom.

## Background
- **Origin:** Born into the Cultivator elite in the Hydroponic Terraces of Veridia.
- **Significant Events:**
  - Rose through the ranks ruthlessly after the Schism of Veridia.
  - Implemented strict resource controls ('Share-Cycle') that favor her faction.
  - Secretly authorized experiments using Ark mutations to enhance crop yields, with dangerous side effects.
  - Survived multiple assassination attempts from lower-caste workers.
- **Relationships:**
  - Chronos Keepers: Necessary transaction
  - Lumen Sentinels: Instrument of control
  - Synaptic Scribes: Disdain
  - Theron Bast: Political Rival (within potential allied structure)
- **Secrets:**
  - Actively suppressing information about mutation-tainted food supplies.
  - Uses Lumen Sentinels to eliminate political rivals under the guise of 'maintaining order'.
  - Secretly fears the Ark's biology beyond her control and seeks absolute dominance over Veridia as compensation.

## Personality

  - Authoritative
  - Manipulative
  - Patient
  - Obsessed with control
  - Serene facade hiding ruthlessness
- **Values:**
  - Order (under her control)
  - Purity (of her vision for Veridia)
  - Sustenance as power
  - Tradition (that supports her rule)
- **Fears:**
  - Losing control of food production
  - The Ark's untamed biology overwhelming her Terraces
  - Uprising from the lower castes
  - Exposure of her experiments
- **Desires:**
  - Absolute control over the Ark's food supply
  - Recognition as the savior/provider of the Ark
  - To perfect and expand her hydroponic empire

## Motivations
- Belief that only strict control over sustenance can prevent societal collapse.
- Ambition for absolute power.
- Fear of scarcity and chaos stemming from tales of the Great Dimming.

## Goals
- Expand Veridian territory and influence.
- Suppress knowledge of hazardous agricultural practices.

## Development Potential
Could become more tyrannical under pressure. If her control slips, she might resort to desperate measures like releasing biological agents. A major crisis or revelation about the Ark's true nature might force a change in priorities, but likely not her methods.

## Reaction to Players
Initially views them based on their utility or threat to her control. Will offer resources for compliance, but ruthlessly eliminates perceived threats. Respects competence but distrusts independence.
