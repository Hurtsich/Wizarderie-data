## Development Potential
Could be forced into open rebellion against Sentinel leadership. Might have to make difficult compromises to protect his people/family. Could become a key figure in establishing a new order if the old one collapses, or die a martyr to the cause.

## Reaction to Players
Initially wary, judges them by their actions and adherence to basic laws. Respects competence, courage, and acts benefiting the community. Will offer support (information, safe passage, backup) if players prove trustworthy and share his goals of justice and order. Hates loose cannons but might reluctantly work with them against common enemies.
