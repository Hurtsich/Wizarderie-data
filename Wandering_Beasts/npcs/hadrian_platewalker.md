Initially treats them as potential customers or minor nuisances. Becomes interested if they possess significant wealth, influence, or offer solutions to his problems (like dealing with troublesome gangs or investigating trade disruptions). Can be bribed or negotiated with. Wary of those who threaten market stability or ask too many awkward questions.
