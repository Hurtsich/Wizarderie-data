## Development Potential
Could be the mastermind behind many seemingly unrelated events. Players might turn one of his agents or uncover his network. Defeating him might destabilize the Syndicate or reveal its true leadership. Might offer a Faustian bargain if cornered.

## Reaction to Players
Views them as pawns on the board. Will attempt to gather information on them subtly, use them indirectly against his enemies, mislead them, or frame them. Avoids direct confrontation unless absolutely necessary, preferring traps, intermediaries, and psychological warfare. If forced into the open, he is dangerously resourceful.
