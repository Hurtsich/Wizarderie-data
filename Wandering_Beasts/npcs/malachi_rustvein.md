Can escalate his destructive methods, potentially triggering disaster. Could be overthrown by rivals or player actions. A very slight chance exists he could be forced into a compromise if faced with overwhelming evidence of imminent, profit-destroying catastrophe.

## Reaction to Players
Initially dismissive, viewing them as insignificant. Will attempt to use them if they seem capable, bribe them if they interfere slightly, or eliminate them ruthlessly if they become a genuine threat to his operations or secrets. Respects power and wealth above all.
