# Morgana - High Priestess of the Awakened Path

## Role
Major Antagonist

## Physical Description
Striking woman with intense, burning eyes and long, dark hair streaked with premature grey. Wears ceremonial robes adorned with cryptic symbols representing Titan anatomy and celestial alignments. Carries an obsidian ritual dagger.

## Background
- **Origin:** A former Shell-Priestess of the Order of the Sacred Shell who experienced a terrifying vision during a Titan tremor.
- **Significant Events:**
  - Survived being trapped deep within Titan tunnels (perhaps The Parasite Tunnels) during a tremor, claiming the Titan 'spoke' to her.
  - Broke away from the Order of the Sacred Shell, denouncing their passive approach.
  - Founded the 'Awakened Path' faction within the Cult of the Sleeper.
  - Has orchestrated several dangerous rituals attempting to 'commune' with or 'awaken' Titans, causing localized instability.
- **Relationships:**
  - Cult of the Sleeper: Leader of a powerful, radical faction.
  - Order of the Sacred Shell: Views them as heretical cowards; bitter schism.
  - Titan Watchers' Confederacy: Considers their scientific approach blasphemous.
  - Lysander Voidgazer: Potentially manipulated by or in cautious contact with, seeking shared goals of influencing Titans.
  - Vesper Scalebright: Personal animosity from their time together in the Order.
- **Secrets:**
  - Her 'communion' involved contact with a parasitic or alien intelligence within the Titan, not the Titan itself.
  - Secretly gathers artifacts related to Titan control, believing they are keys to awakening.
  - Is responsible for specific localized disasters blamed on natural Titan activity or other factions.
  - Suffers from visions that are slowly driving her mad.

## Personality
- **Traits:**
  - Fanatical
  - Charismatic
  - Driven
  - Obsessive
  - Zealous
  - Manipulative
- **Values:**
  - The 'will' of the Titans (as she interprets it)
  - Spiritual 'truth' over mortal lives
  - Sacrifice for the greater cause
  - Destiny
- **Fears:**
  - The Titans dying before they 'awaken'
  - Her followers losing faith
  - Being proven wrong or deemed insignificant
  - The entity she contacted abandoning her
- **Desires:**
  - To force the Titans to awaken fully, ushering in a new era
  - To be the chief interpreter of the awakened Titans' will
  - To punish those who exploit or disrespect the Titans (in her view)

## Motivations
- Absolute conviction in her divine mandate.
- Belief that awakening the Titans is the only way to save them/humanity from stagnation or destruction.
- Trauma and distorted understanding from her initial vision.

## Goals
- Perform a grand ritual capable of awakening a Titan or establishing permanent communion.
- Gather followers and resources across multiple Titans.

## Development Potential
Could succeed in causing a major awakening event with catastrophic consequences. Might be revealed as a pawn of a deeper entity. Could potentially be reasoned with if confronted with the true nature of her 'communion' or the devastating costs of her actions, possibly leading to a crisis of faith.

## Reaction to Players
Sees them as potential converts, insignificant insects, or dangerous heretics depending on their actions and beliefs. Will try to manipulate or convert them initially. Becomes violently hostile if they oppose her dogma or interfere with her plans.
