**Development Potential:** Can offer quests related to local defense, investigating disappearances, patrolling dangerous areas, or dealing with minor threats the militia can't handle. Might provide access to militia resources or local intelligence if players gain his trust.

Willing to hire help for tasks his own troops can't manage, but expects professionalism and results. Can become a grateful ally if players reliably solve problems without causing new ones.
