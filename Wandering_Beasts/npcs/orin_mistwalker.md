## Development Potential
Can provide the players with passage between Titans, offer crucial information about sky-routes and port cities, and potentially involve them in his personal quests or smuggling runs. His cynicism might soften if the players prove genuinely heroic. Could become a key figure in navigating the complex world of sky-trade and piracy.

## Reaction to Players
Initially wary and business-like. Judges based on practicality and whether they seem like trouble or potential profit. Offers passage for a price (money, favors, or completing a task for him). Can become a loyal friend and ally if they prove trustworthy, reliable, and help him out of a tight spot, especially if they share his enemies (like Sky-Jackals or oppressive Concordat officials).
