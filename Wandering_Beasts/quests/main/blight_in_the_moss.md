## Description
A strange blight is spreading from the edges of the Whispering Chitin Forest, sickening the unique flora cultivated in Mossgrove and warping local fauna. Master Herbalist Willow Mossbeard seeks aid to diagnose the blight's nature and find a cure before it devastates the region and its dependent ecosystem.

## Prerequisites
- Campaign Start (Arc 1)

## Objectives
### Investigate the nature and origin of the blight affecting Mossgrove and the Whispering Chitin Forest.

**Success Conditions:**

- Identify the blight's source (e.g., toxic runoff, parasitic fungus, Cultist ritual).
- Track the blight's spread pattern.

**Failure Conditions:**
- The blight spreads uncontrollably, devastating Mossgrove's ecosystem.
- The party becomes infected or severely hampered by the blight's effects.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- The blight is identified as a natural (but aggressive) Titan process.
- Evidence points towards accidental contamination from nearby Ambervein or Deepwell operations.
- Clues suggest deliberate poisoning linked to the Horizon Syndicate or Cult of the Sleeper.
### Consult with Master Herbalist Willow Mossbeard to analyze samples and research potential cures or countermeasures.

**Success Conditions:**

- Assist Willow in identifying key components of the blight.
- Help research potential remedies in local lore or guild records.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Willow Mossbeard is harmed or her workshop is destroyed.

### Locate the blight's epicenter or primary source within the Whispering Chitin Forest or nearby hazardous zones (like Sporebloom Thicket).

**Success Conditions:**
- Successfully navigate the hazardous environment.
- Identify and reach the source location.
- Neutralize or contain the source (if possible).

**Failure Conditions:**
- The party is overwhelmed by blighted creatures or environmental hazards.
- The source proves impossible to neutralize with current resources.
