# Echoes of the Sleeper

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Exploration, Investigation, Combat, Ritual Disruption
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Estimated Duration:** 4-5 sessions

## Description
The fanatical Cult of the Sleeper, led by High Priestess Morgana, is preparing a dangerous ritual at a sacred or hidden site (like the Temple of the Sleeping Giant or a Cultist's Crevasse) intended to 'awaken' the Titan or commune with its perceived consciousness. The party must locate the ritual site, uncover the specifics of the Cult's plan, and intervene before they trigger a catastrophe.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Arc 2 quests.
- Evidence implicating the Cult of the Sleeper in Titan instability or unnatural events.

## Objectives
### Locate the Cult of the Sleeper's hidden ritual site.

**Success Conditions:**
- Follow clues gathered previously (e.g., from 'Blight in the Moss' or 'The Spire's Shadow').
- Track Cultist movements or supply lines.
- Interpret ancient texts or prophecies pointing to the location (e.g., Temple of the Sleeping Giant).
- Successfully navigate hazards guarding the approach (natural or Cultist traps).

**Failure Conditions:**
- The party gets lost or is unable to find the site before the ritual commences.
- The party alerts the Cult to their approach prematurely.
- Key clues are misinterpreted, leading to the wrong location.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- The site is found, but is different than expected (e.g., a network of caves like the Cultist's Crevasse, not a grand temple).
- The party finds multiple potential sites, needing to determine the correct one.
- An unexpected ally (e.g., a disillusioned Cultist, Vesper Scalebright) provides the location.
### Determine the nature and purpose of the Cult's ritual.

**Success Conditions:**
- Infiltrate the site or observe undetected.
- Capture and interrogate a knowledgeable Cultist.
- Find ritual texts, diagrams, or components.
- Understand the intended effect (e.g., forced awakening, mind control, energy siphoning) and the potential consequences.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Unable to learn the ritual's specifics before it begins.
- Information gathered is incomplete or misleading.
- The ritual's true nature is far worse than anticipated.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover the Cult is being manipulated by Morgana based on flawed visions.
- Learn the ritual requires a specific artifact (Heartstone Relic?) or sacrifice.
- Find evidence the ritual is empowered by the Horizon Syndicate.
- Realize the ritual might unintentionally breach a barrier to the 'Titan Within'.
### Disrupt the Cult's ritual before it reaches completion.

**Success Conditions:**
- Intervene at a critical moment.
- Destroy key ritual components or focuses.
- Defeat or incapacitate High Priestess Morgana and her key lieutenants.
- Prevent the catastrophic intended effect.

**Failure Conditions:**
- The ritual is completed, causing a major Titan reaction (e.g., localized awakening, massive tremor, release of psychic energy).
- The party is defeated or captured by the Cultists.
- Stopping the ritual has unforeseen negative consequences (e.g., destabilizing the Titan further).

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- The ritual is only partially successful, with altered or lesser effects.
- Stopping the ritual requires a sacrifice from the party or an ally.
- Morgana escapes, vowing revenge.
- The entity Morgana contacted manifests or influences events directly.
- The party manages to co-opt or redirect the ritual energy for a different purpose (very risky).

## Key NPCs
- Morgana
- Cult of the Sleeper Zealots
- Vesper Scalebright (potential ally/opponent depending on ritual nature)
- Lysander Voidgazer (possibly manipulating the Cult)

## Key Locations
- The Temple of the Sleeping Giant
- The Cultist's Crevasse
- The Crystal Spine Peaks (possible location)
- The Parasite Tunnels (site of Morgana's vision)
- Secret shrine/cavern

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Prevention of a potentially catastrophic Titan event. Significant blow dealt to the Cult of the Sleeper.
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Unique Cultist artifacts or ritual components.
  - Knowledge about Titan consciousness, parasitic entities, or forbidden rituals.
  - Gratitude from factions opposing the Cult (Order of the Sacred Shell, Titan Watchers).
  - Map to other Cultist cells or hidden locations.
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - Morgana's personal journal detailing her visions and contact.
  - A fragment of a Heartstone Relic used in the ritual.
  - Secret passages within the Temple of the Sleeping Giant.
  - Information linking the Cult to the Horizon Syndicate.
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Cult of the Sleeper: Extremely Negative - Directly opposed and disrupted.
  - Order of the Sacred Shell: Positive - Dealt with dangerous heretics.
  - Titan Watchers' Confederacy: Positive - Prevented a major destabilizing event.
  - Spinecrest Collective: Positive - Neutralized a dangerous extremist group.

## Branching Paths
- Attempt to capture Morgana for interrogation or deprogramming.
- Try to reason with disillusioned Cultists to turn them against Morgana.
- Focus on destroying the ritual components versus confronting Morgana directly.
- Seek aid from Vesper Scalebright and the Order of the Sacred Shell to counter the ritual.
- Alert the Titan Watchers or Spinecrest Collective and coordinate a larger assault (risking the ritual completing first).

## Optional Content
- Rescue prisoners intended for sacrifice by the Cult.
- Consecrate/Cleanse the desecrated ritual site for the Order of the Sacred Shell.
- Recover historical artifacts from the Temple of the Sleeping Giant.
- Track down Cultist cells operating in nearby settlements based on information found at the site.
