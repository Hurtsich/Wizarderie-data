# Passage to Spinecrest

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Diplomacy, Social Interaction, Logistics, Travel, potential Combat
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Estimated Duration:** 2-3 sessions

## Description
Following leads suggesting the Titan instability is widespread, the party must secure passage from their current location (e.g., Windshear Landing) to the major political hub of Spinecrest on another Titan. This requires navigating the treacherous bureaucracy, high costs, and potential dangers of sky-travel, including the perilous Cloudshear Archipelago.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of an Arc 1 quest (e.g., 'The Tremors Below Ironfoot Hold' or 'Blight in the Moss')
- Need to reach Spinecrest for information or contacts (e.g., Titan Watchers' HQ).

## Objectives
### Find a sky-ship captain willing and able to travel to Spinecrest.

**Success Conditions:**
- Identify potential captains (e.g., Orin Mistwalker, Concordat captains).
- Successfully negotiate passage (payment, service, or favor).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Unable to find or afford passage.
- Alienate all potential captains.
- End up stranded at the port.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Secure passage on a cheaper but less reliable vessel.
- Sign on as crew to pay for passage, requiring work during the voyage.
- Are forced to stow away, risking discovery.
- Join a Sky-Traders' Concordat convoy for safety, but subject to their rules.
### Navigate the bureaucratic hurdles of departing the port (e.g., Windshear Landing).

**Success Conditions:**
- Obtain necessary exit permits/clearances.
- Pass cargo inspections (if any).
- Avoid trouble with port authorities or guilds (like the Sky-Shipwrights' Union).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Detained by authorities.
- Ship is grounded due to permit issues.
- Critical cargo is confiscated.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Bribe officials to expedite the process.
- Use connections (e.g., Linnea Windrider) to smooth things over.
- Are forced to leave under cover of darkness.
### Survive the journey through the Cloudshear Archipelago.

**Success Conditions:**
- Successfully navigate atmospheric hazards (storms, windshear).
- Avoid or overcome encounters with sky-predators.
- Avoid or repel attacks from Sky-Jackals.
- Reach the destination Titan airspace safely.

**Failure Conditions:**
- The ship is critically damaged or destroyed.
- The party is captured by Sky-Jackals.
- The ship is thrown severely off course, becoming lost.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- The ship detours via a notable landmark (e.g., The Skyship Graveyard, Sky-Kraken's Rest).
- The party rescues another vessel in distress.
- The party discovers signs of unusual activity in the Archipelago (e.g., Syndicate smuggling routes).

## Branching Paths
