# The Caldera's Secret

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Infiltration, Exploration, Combat, Sabotage
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Estimated Duration:** 4-5 sessions

## Description
Evidence points to the Deepwell Mining Consortium's aggressive operations in the volatile Molten Heart Caldera as a major source of Titan instability. The party must infiltrate the Consortium's heavily guarded deep-drilling site or associated facilities (like the Sunken Geothermal Plant) to uncover the truth about their experiments and potentially sabotage their harmful activities.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Arc 2 quests (e.g., 'The Spire's Shadow').
- Evidence implicating the Deepwell Mining Consortium and the Molten Heart Caldera.

## Objectives
### Infiltrate the Deepwell Mining Consortium's primary operation site within the Molten Heart Caldera.

**Success Conditions:**
- Bypass or overcome Consortium security patrols and defenses.
- Gain access to the main drilling platform, research labs, or control center.
- Avoid triggering a full lockdown or site-wide alert.

**Failure Conditions:**
- The party is detected and captured or forced to retreat.
- The facility is put on high alert, making further progress extremely difficult.
- Key infiltration routes are destroyed or blocked.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- The party uses forged credentials or bribes guards for limited access.
- The party allies with disgruntled miners (like contacts of Joric Deepdelver) to create a diversion.
- Infiltration leads to the Sunken Geothermal Plant instead of the main drill site.
### Discover the nature of the Consortium's activities causing Titan instability.

**Success Conditions:**
- Access research logs, data cores, or experimental prototypes.
- Witness dangerous procedures (e.g., uncontrolled geothermal tapping, attempts to drill into Titan organs).
- Obtain verifiable proof of reckless or forbidden experiments.
- Identify key personnel involved (e.g., Vein Lord Malachi Rustvein's direct orders).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Unable to access or understand the critical data.
- Evidence is destroyed before it can be secured.
- The party is misled by falsified data.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover the Consortium is unknowingly aggravating a natural Titan process.
- Find evidence the Consortium is using technology scavenged from ancient ruins.
- Learn the Consortium is secretly collaborating with or being manipulated by the Horizon Syndicate.
### Disrupt or sabotage the harmful Consortium operations (optional).

**Success Conditions:**
- Successfully disable key drilling equipment or experimental apparatus.
- Cause a significant setback to the Consortium's project without causing catastrophic collateral damage.
- Escape the facility after the sabotage.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Sabotage attempt fails or backfires, causing unintended destruction or alerting all guards.
- The party is captured during the attempt.
- The sabotage has minimal long-term impact on Consortium operations.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- The party triggers a controlled shutdown instead of destructive sabotage.
- Sabotage inadvertently releases a dangerous creature or hazard contained by the Consortium.
- The party steals a key component or prototype instead of outright destruction.

## Key NPCs
- Malachi Rustvein (potential confrontation)
- Joric Deepdelver (potential ally/informant)
- Consortium Scientists/Guards
- Lysander Voidgazer (possibly observing)

## Key Locations
- The Molten Heart Caldera
- Deepwell Mining Consortium Drill Site
- Sunken Geothermal Plant
- Deepwell (Consortium HQ)
- The Geothermal Vents District

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Conclusive evidence of the Deepwell Mining Consortium's role in the Titan instability. Potential to significantly hinder their operations.
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Advanced mining technology or schematics.
  - Valuable geological data about the Titan's interior.
  - Significant resources (credits, rare minerals) if Consortium vaults are accessed.
  - Consortium security codes or patrol routes.
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - Malachi Rustvein's personal logs revealing greater ambitions or Syndicate ties.
  - A unique geothermal-powered artifact.
  - Map to an undiscovered section of the Geothermal Vents District.
  - Proof of unethical human experimentation.
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Deepwell Mining Consortium: Extremely Negative - Actively sabotaged and exposed.
  - Prospectors' Union: Extremely Positive - Struck a blow against their oppressor.
  - Titan Watchers' Confederacy: Positive - Provided crucial evidence.
  - Order of the Sacred Shell: Positive - Halted desecration of the Titan.

## Branching Paths
- Focus on gathering evidence to expose the Consortium publicly.
- Focus on sabotage to cripple their operation immediately.
- Attempt to confront Malachi Rustvein directly.
- Leak findings to a rival faction (like the Amber Vein Cartel or even the Syndicate) to create chaos.
- Ally with Joric Deepdelver to incite a worker uprising.

## Optional Content
- Rescue imprisoned workers or test subjects from Consortium labs.
- Disable Consortium surveillance systems across the Caldera.
- Map the unstable lava tubes within the Molten Heart Caldera.
- Investigate the dilapidated Sunken Geothermal Plant for clues or salvage.
