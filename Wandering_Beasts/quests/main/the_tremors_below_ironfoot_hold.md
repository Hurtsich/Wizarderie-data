# The Tremors Below Ironfoot Hold

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Investigation, Exploration, Combat
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Estimated Duration:** 3-4 sessions

## Description
Investigate increasingly violent tremors shaking Ironfoot Hold and the surrounding Footfall Barrens. Locals whisper of angered earth spirits, but miners suspect activity in the old Collapsed Ridge Mines. Discover the source of the disturbance before the hold suffers critical damage.

## Prerequisites
- Campaign Start (Arc 1)

## Objectives
### Investigate the cause and source of the tremors affecting Ironfoot Hold.

**Success Conditions:**
- Identify the epicenter of the tremors within the Collapsed Ridge Mines.
- Determine if the cause is natural Titan activity, Deepwell Mining Consortium operations, or something else.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Ironfoot Hold suffers major structural failure due to unchecked tremors.
- The party abandons the investigation without identifying the source.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- The party misidentifies the cause, potentially angering an innocent faction.
- The party finds evidence implicating the Consortium but lacks proof.
- The tremors are temporarily stopped but the underlying cause remains hidden.
### Explore the Collapsed Ridge Mines to locate the tremor epicenter.

**Success Conditions:**
- Navigate the unstable mines.
- Reach the area identified as the likely source.
- Survive encounters with destabilized creatures or mining hazards.

**Failure Conditions:**
- The party becomes trapped or killed within the mines.
- The entrance collapses, preventing further exploration without significant effort.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- The party finds signs of recent, unauthorized Consortium drilling equipment.
- The party discovers unusual geological formations suggesting natural Titan stress.
- The party finds evidence of Cult of the Sleeper activity.
### Report findings to relevant authorities in Ironfoot Hold (e.g., Master Blacksmith Torvin Ironfoot or Prospector Foreman Joric Deepdelver).

**Success Conditions:**
- Provide credible evidence about the tremors' source.
- Gain the trust of local figures.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Findings are dismissed due to lack of proof or poor reputation.
- Evidence is stolen or lost.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Reporting findings leads to conflict with the Deepwell Mining Consortium.
- Findings attract the attention of the Titan Watchers' Confederacy.
