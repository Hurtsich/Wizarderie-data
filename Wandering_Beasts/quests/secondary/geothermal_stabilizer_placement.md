# Geothermal Stabilizer Placement

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Deployment, Environmental Hazard, Combat
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Estimated Duration:** 3-5 hours

## Description
Recent aggressive drilling by the Deepwell Mining Consortium in the Geothermal Vents District has caused dangerous pressure fluctuations, threatening nearby tunnels. The Consortium urgently needs skilled operatives to place experimental stabilizers near volatile vents, navigating extreme heat, toxic gases, and aggressive thermophilic creatures. Speed is prioritized over safety.

## Prerequisites
- Access to Deepwell and the Geothermal Vents District
- Adequate heat and toxin resistance (gear/magic/consumables)
- Neutral or higher reputation with Deepwell Mining Consortium OR desperation for high pay

## Objectives
### Escort Consortium technicians carrying stabilizer devices (or carry the devices themselves if technicians are unavailable/unwilling) to three designated unstable geothermal vents. Clear out hostile creatures (e.g., Magma Mephits, Lava Worms, Cinder Swarms). Deploy and activate the stabilizers correctly before critical pressure overload occurs (potentially timed element per location).

**Success Conditions:**
- All three stabilizers successfully deployed and activated according to procedure.
- Return to the Consortium foreman in Deepwell.
- Avoid catastrophic vent eruption at deployment sites.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Player party wiped out by environmental hazards or creatures.
- Stabilizer devices destroyed before deployment.
- Critical pressure overload occurs at one or more sites, causing localized eruptions/damage.
- Consortium technicians (if present) are killed before deployment.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Only one or two stabilizers deployed (partial success, reduced reward, potential for future instability in the district).
- Discover the stabilizers have a hidden, secondary function (e.g., covert resource scanning, siphoning pure geothermal energy, Titan monitoring for non-safety reasons).
- Find evidence suggesting the instability was deliberately caused by Consortium testing of new drilling tech or weapons.
- The stabilizers malfunction shortly after placement, requiring a hasty retreat or further intervention.

## Key NPCs
- Consortium Foreman 'Fendrel Stonehand' (Quest Giver, pragmatic, stressed, emphasizes speed over safety)
- Malachi Rustvein (Vein Lord, Overseeing the operation's success from Deepwell, may contact via comms)
- Joric Deepdelver (Prospector Foreman, Might privately warn players about the extreme dangers and the Consortium cutting corners on safety)

## Key Locations
- Deepwell (briefing/debriefing)
- The Geothermal Vents District (main operation area, extreme heat/toxins)
- The Sunken Geothermal Plant (nearby ruins, potential source of salvage or danger)

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Set of Masterwork heat-resistant armor OR significant gear upgrade providing heat/toxin resistance.
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Very large gold payment.
  - Geothermal energy crystal (can be used as a minor power source or sold for high value).
  - Consortium 'Hazard Pay' chit (one-time bonus payment or favor).
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - Salvaging intact, advanced technology or components from the nearby Sunken Geothermal Plant.
  - Finding rare, heat-resistant mineral veins exposed by the recent instability.
  - Obtaining data logs or diagnostic readouts from the stabilizers revealing their hidden function or the true cause of the instability.
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Deepwell Mining Consortium: +Significant
  - Titan Watchers' Confederacy: -Minor (if methods seem reckless or environmentally damaging)
  - Prospectors' Union: Neutral (appreciate hazard reduction) to -Minor (if Consortium recklessness confirmed)

## Branching Paths
- Decide whether to investigate the stabilizers' potential hidden functions or the suspicious cause of the instability, potentially angering the Consortium.
- Prioritize speed and risk (Consortium's wish) versus caution and safety (potentially missing timed elements but ensuring survival/success at fewer sites).
- Choose whether to report anomalous findings (hidden functions, sabotage evidence) and to whom (Consortium, Watchers, Union).

## Optional Content
- Rescue trapped independent prospectors or Consortium miners encountered near the vents.
- Map the safest paths through the volatile Vents District for future use or sale.
- Collect samples of unique thermophile organisms for the Alchemists' Circle or a Skyreach Academy biologist.
