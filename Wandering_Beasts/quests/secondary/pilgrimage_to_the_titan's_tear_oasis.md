# Pilgrimage to the Titan's Tear Oasis

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Escort, Combat, Exploration (Land)
- **Difficulty:** Medium-Hard
- **Estimated Duration:** 4-6 hours

## Description
An annual pilgrimage to the sacred Titan's Tear Oasis Belt is due, but heightened dangers in the surrounding Scalemail Desert and Footfall Barrens (aggressive fauna, increased Ridge Reaver activity) make the journey unsafe for the faithful. The Order of the Sacred Shell needs capable guardians to escort a small group of pilgrims led by the devout Shell-Priest Finnan.

## Prerequisites
- Access to the region near the Oasis Belt (e.g., edge of Scalemail Desert, potentially via Plateau Market or Anchorstone)
- Good or higher reputation with the Order of the Sacred Shell
- Preparedness for desert travel

## Objectives
### Meet Shell-Priest Finnan and three designated pilgrims at a staging point. Guide them safely across the hazardous desert and barrens terrain to the Titan's Tear Oasis Belt. Protect the group from ambushes by Ridge Reavers and attacks by dangerous desert creatures (e.g., Sand Skitterers, Dune Drakes). Ensure the pilgrims can perform their sacred rites undisturbed at the main Oasis pool.

**Success Conditions:**
- Shell-Priest Finnan and at least two pilgrims arrive safely at the Oasis.
- The pilgrims successfully complete their rites without major interruption.
- The party and surviving pilgrims return safely to the staging point (or another designated safe location).

**Failure Conditions:**
- Shell-Priest Finnan is killed or incapacitated.
- Fewer than two pilgrims survive the journey to the Oasis.
- Players abandon the escort mission.
- Ridge Reavers disrupt the sacred rites at the Oasis.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Discover the Ridge Reavers are specifically targeting a relic or sacred object carried secretly by Finnan.
- Find evidence near the Oasis that the 'tears' (water source) are diminishing or being contaminated, possibly due to distant Deepwell Mining Consortium activity.
- Convince a faction of Ridge Reavers to abandon their attack or grant safe passage through negotiation, intimidation, or by defeating their chieftain.
- Only one pilgrim survives, but Finnan lives and completes the rites (partial success, Order is saddened but grateful).

## Key NPCs
- Shell-Priest Finnan (Quest Giver, Devout Leader, VIP)
- Pilgrims (Vulnerable NPCs with simple needs/faith)
- Ridge Reaver Chieftain (Antagonist, e.g., 'Gideon Dustfoot' - perhaps a fallen Nomadic Clans member)
- Desert Nomads (Potential neutral encounters, sources of information or trade)

## Key Locations
- Titan's Tear Oasis Belt (Destination, series of oases)
- The Scalemail Desert (Primary travel zone)
- The Footfall Barrens (Hazardous connecting region)
- Ridge Reaver Camp (Potential encounter/raid location)
- Staging Point (e.g., small shrine near desert edge)

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Vial of Purified Oasis Water (Potent consumable healing item or alchemical ingredient), Order's Protective Amulet (provides minor resistance to desert hazards or divine protection).
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Generous donation of gold or supplies from the Order of the Sacred Shell.
  - Detailed map of the Oasis Belt region, including safe water sources, provided by Finnan.
  - Blessing from Finnan upon successful completion.
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - Finding a rare Silken Desert Bloom near the Oasis, valuable to Herbalists or Alchemists.
  - Recovering a Ridge Reaver map showing hidden water sources, patrol routes, or treasure locations in the desert.
  - Earning Finnan's personal, lasting blessing (minor social bonus with all Order members, potential future aid).
  - Discovering ancient markings near the Oasis hinting at its true nature or history.
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Order of the Sacred Shell: +Significant
  - Ridge Reavers: -Moderate (if fought)
  - Nomadic Clans Alliance: Neutral to -Minor (if Ridge Reavers were former clan members)

## Branching Paths
- Choose how to handle Ridge Reaver encounters: direct combat, stealthy evasion, negotiation/intimidation.
- Decide whether to investigate the potential mining impact on the Oasis, potentially creating conflict with the Consortium but pleasing the Order/Watchers.
- Decide whether to actively hunt down the Ridge Reaver camp based on encountered evidence or tracks.
- Choose routes through the desert: safer but longer, or faster but more hazardous.

## Optional Content
- Forage for rare desert herbs or hunt desert creatures for valuable pelts/components along the route.
- Locate and map alternative, potentially safer paths for future pilgrimages.
- Help the pilgrims document unique Oasis flora and fauna for the Order's records or the Veridian Preservation Society.
