# Planting Seeds of Doubt

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Deception, Stealth, Framing, Infiltration
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Estimated Duration:** 4-6 hours

## Description
The Horizon Syndicate seeks to destabilize the region by exacerbating tensions between the Spinecrest Collective and the Carapace Legion. Whisper Agent Prime Lysander Voidgazer tasks the players with a high-risk mission: plant carefully falsified evidence suggesting each faction is planning imminent aggression against the other. Absolute secrecy and plausible deniability are crucial.

## Prerequisites
- Established contact and earned a degree of trust with the Horizon Syndicate (e.g., successfully completed 'The Whispering Ledger').
- Ability to access both Spinecrest (likely Sky-Marshal's offices or Council chambers) and Carapace Town (Legion command center).
- High proficiency in stealth, deception, and possibly forgery (if adjusting plans).

## Objectives
### Receive two packages of forged documents and potentially small, incriminating items from Lysander Voidgazer or a designated cutout. Infiltrate a secure Spinecrest Collective location (e.g., Sky-Marshal Elara Skyborn's strategy chamber, a courier dispatch) and plant the evidence implicating the Carapace Legion in plotting an attack. Separately, infiltrate a secure Carapace Legion location (e.g., Commander Astrid Ironfoot's briefing room, an armory log) and plant the evidence implicating Spinecrest in planning an invasion. Escape both locations entirely undetected, leaving the evidence to be 'discovered' naturally.

**Success Conditions:**
- Both sets of forged evidence successfully planted in plausible locations within the target HQs.
- No detection during infiltration or escape from either location.
- Players report successful placement back to Lysander or cutout without compromising themselves or the Syndicate.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Getting caught planting the evidence (likely leading to capture, interrogation, and exposure).
- The evidence being discovered immediately upon planting and traced back to the players or Syndicate.
- Losing the forged evidence before placement.
- Alerting high security in either HQ, forcing mission abort.
- Being identified by key NPCs like Elara, Astrid, or observant guards like Corbin Ashfall.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Only one set of evidence successfully planted (partial success, Lysander is severely displeased, reduced reward, increased suspicion on players).
- Evidence planted but discovered later than intended (causes some friction but less effectively than planned, Syndicate may blame players' sloppiness).
- Players are detected but manage to escape (Syndicate likely cuts ties immediately, players become hunted by both factions and potentially the Syndicate).
- Players decide to keep the evidence and attempt to expose the Syndicate's plot to one or both factions (extremely dangerous).

## Key NPCs
- Lysander Voidgazer (Whisper Agent Prime, Quest Giver, provides forgeries)
- Sky-Marshal Elara Skyborn (Head of Spinecrest security obstacle)
- Carapace Commander Astrid Ironfoot (Head of Carapace Legion security obstacle)
- Summit Guard Sergeant Corbin Ashfall (Potentially suspicious guard in Spinecrest, might notice discrepancies)
- Shellguard Sentries (Obstacles in Carapace Town)
- Syndicate Cutout/Dead-drop contact

## Key Locations
- Spinecrest (High Council Chamber area, Sky-Marshal's office wing, secure archives)
- Carapace Town (Legion Barracks Command Center, secure briefing rooms, armory records)
- Hidden Syndicate dead-drop locations or meeting points for briefing/debriefing.
- Under-Plate passages (Carapace Town infiltration route)
- Spire elevators/maintenance shafts (Spinecrest infiltration route)

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Very large payment in rare resources (e.g., refined amber, rare alloys) or Syndicate crypto-currency, Access to a restricted Syndicate safe house network or high-level information broker.
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Advanced infiltration gear (e.g., chameleon cloak, sound dampening boots).
  - Significant favor from Lysander Voidgazer (potentially leading to more dangerous/rewarding missions).
  - Detailed internal layouts of target faction HQs (from mission planning).
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - Finding genuine intelligence reports, troop rosters, or strategic plans while planting the fakes.
  - Discovering the identity or coded communication method of a Syndicate mole within one of the target factions.
  - Acquiring personal blackmail material on Elara or Astrid.
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - The Horizon Syndicate: +Significant (if successful and discreet)
  - Spinecrest Collective: -Significant (if caught or linked)
  - Carapace Legion: -Significant (if caught or linked)

## Branching Paths
- Choose infiltration methods for both high-security locations (timing, route, disguise, distraction).
- Decide whether to actually plant the evidence, attempt to substitute it, destroy it, or deliver it to the targeted faction as a warning.
- Choose whether to use the opportunity to steal *real* intelligence for personal gain, another faction, or to further understand the Syndicate's goals.
- Decide how to handle unexpected patrols or security sweeps during the infiltration.

## Optional Content
- Create additional diversions (e.g., minor fire, false alarm) to aid infiltration, potentially causing collateral damage or suspicion.
- Gather intel on faction troop movements, resource stockpiles, or leadership morale while inside their HQs.
- Plant subtle personal calling cards or misleading clues to misdirect blame onto another group (e.g., make it look like Sky-Jackal espionage or Cultist troublemaking) - very risky.
- Leave anonymous warnings for individuals within the targeted factions (e.g., Corbin Ashfall, a specific Shellguard).
