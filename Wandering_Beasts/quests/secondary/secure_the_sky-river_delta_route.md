# Secure the Sky-River Delta Route

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Escort, Combat, Exploration (Sky)
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Estimated Duration:** 4-6 hours

## Description
The Sky-Traders' Concordat wants to establish a new, profitable route through the volatile Sky-River Delta, but frequent Sky-Jackal activity and aggressive airborne fauna make it too hazardous. Concord Ambassador Cassian needs capable escorts for a survey mission to clear the route and intimidate pirate presence.

## Prerequisites
- Access to a sky-ship (owned or chartered)
- Proven combat proficiency (especially ship-to-ship or ranged)
- Neutral or higher reputation with The Sky-Traders' Concordat

## Objectives
### Escort Ambassador Cassian's designated survey vessel through the Sky-River Delta from a starting point (e.g., Windshear Landing) to a destination anchorage (e.g., near Mistral Perch). Defend against Sky-Jackal raiding parties and hazardous airborne creatures (e.g., Storm Eels, Razorwings). Plant Concordat navigation beacons at three pre-determined coordinates.

**Success Conditions:**
- Ambassador Cassian's vessel reaches the destination anchorage intact.
- Route significantly cleared of immediate major threats (multiple pirate/creature encounters defeated).
- All three navigation beacons successfully deployed.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Ambassador Cassian's vessel is destroyed or captured.
- The players' own sky-ship is destroyed.
- Ambassador Cassian is killed or captured.
- Failure to deploy at least two beacons.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Route cleared but Cassian's vessel heavily damaged (reduced monetary reward, Cassian is less pleased).
- Discover a hidden Sky-Jackal staging post (provides coordinates for a future raid quest).
- Attempt to negotiate passage with a specific Sky-Jackal faction (requires specific circumstances, high risk, unlikely but possible leading to unique outcomes).

## Key NPCs
- Concord Ambassador Cassian (Quest Giver, Pompous but important VIP)
- Orin Mistwalker (Sky-Trader Captain, Could be hired as pilot, or encountered as a rival also scouting the route)
- Sky-Jackal Captain 'Ripper' Rhys (Antagonist, leads local pirate squadron)
- Players' Sky-ship Crew

## Key Locations
- Sky-River Delta (region between Titans)
- The Cloudshear Archipelago
- Starting Port (e.g., Windshear Landing)
- Destination Anchorage (e.g., near Mistral Perch)
- Potential hidden Sky-Pirate's Hidden Cove nearby

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Concordat Trade Permit (granting preferential docking fees and access at Concordat-controlled ports for a period), Commendation from a Sky-Trader Prince.
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Large payment in gold or valuable trade goods (e.g., rare Titan minerals).
  - Salvage rights to defeated pirate vessels and their cargo.
  - Concordat Safe Passage Ensign (Reduces likelihood of Concordat patrol interference).
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - Recovering Captain Rhys's logbook detailing pirate routes, contacts, and treasure caches.
  - Finding a rare Cloud Coral sample during the journey through dense sky-fog.
  - Cassian may offer a lucrative, slightly shady private contract if impressed.
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Sky-Traders' Concordat: +Significant
  - Sky-Jackals: -Significant
  - Independent Sky-Traders: Neutral to +Minor (safer routes benefit them too)

## Branching Paths
- Decide whether to prioritize attacking the Sky-Jackal staging post if found, or focus solely on the escort mission.
- Choose tactics during engagements: focus fire on pirate ships, board enemy vessels, use environmental hazards (if any).
- Decide how much risk to take protecting Cassian's often less-defensible ship versus preserving the players' own vessel.

## Optional Content
- Map navigational hazards (e.g., strong currents, floating debris fields) within the Delta for the Cartographers' Society.
- Rescue independent merchants found under attack by pirates or creatures.
- Harvest valuable components from defeated sky creatures.
