# The Ambervein Claim Jumpers

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Combat, Intimidation, Moral Choice
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Estimated Duration:** 2-3 hours

## Description
Vein Lord Malachi Rustvein, via his Amber Vein Cartel enforcers, is furious about independent prospectors encroaching on 'exclusive' territory in the Amber Forests near Ambervein. He wants these 'thieves' persuaded to leave, permanently, and any harvested amber confiscated.

## Prerequisites
- Access to the Ambervein region
- Willingness to work with criminal elements OR Neutral reputation with Deepwell Mining Consortium/Amber Vein Cartel

## Objectives
### Locate the independent prospectors' hidden camp(s) within the treacherous Amber Forests. Force them to abandon their claims and leave the region immediately, using intimidation or force as deemed necessary by the Cartel contact. Recover any significant quantities of harvested Titan Amber.

**Success Conditions:**
- Prospectors abandon their claims and flee the territory.
- Recovered amber (if any) is returned to the Cartel contact.
- Players maintain discretion regarding Cartel involvement.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Prospectors successfully fight off the players or escape with significant amounts of amber.
- Players refuse the task after accepting or openly defy the Cartel.
- Players are captured or killed by the prospectors or forest hazards.
- Local authorities (if any) are alerted and intervene.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Persuade the prospectors to leave peacefully through threats or negotiation (requires high social skills; Cartel contact might be slightly displeased by lack of violence but accepts the result).
- Secretly help the prospectors escape with their findings (making enemies of the Consortium/Cartel, potentially gaining favor with Prospectors' Union).
- Cut a deal with the prospectors to exploit the claim secretly, paying off the players (high risk of Cartel retribution if discovered).
- Eliminate the prospectors entirely (satisfies the Cartel's ruthlessness but carries moral weight).

## Key NPCs
- Amber Vein Cartel Enforcer (Quest Giver, e.g., 'Borin Rustvein' - Malachi's ruthless cousin)
- Independent Prospector Leader (e.g., 'Elias Deepdelver' - perhaps estranged kin of Joric/Seraphina, desperate)
- Amber Vein Cartel thugs (Accompany players or act as backup/rivals)
- Malachi Rustvein (Vein Lord, Ultimate client, unlikely to interact directly)

## Key Locations
- Ambervein (briefing location)
- The Amber Forests (hazardous region, location of camps)
- Hidden prospector camps
- Vein Tappers' hideout (potential source of rumors or conflict)

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Large sum of gold or equivalent value in raw Titan Amber, Marked favor with the Amber Vein Cartel (may provide access or protection).
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Map detailing Consortium/Cartel patrol routes and known hazards in the Amber Forests.
  - Set of Cartel enforcer gear (armor, weapons).
  - Information broker contact within Ambervein.
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - Finding a prospector's map hinting at a richer, previously undiscovered amber deposit deeper in the forest.
  - Learning critical information about the Cartel's internal structure, rivalries, or weaknesses from the prospectors.
  - Recovering a unique fossil trapped in amber from the prospector's findings.
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Deepwell Mining Consortium: +Moderate (as Cartel serves their interests here)
  - Amber Vein Cartel: +Significant
  - Prospectors' Union: -Significant (if violence used or prospectors reported)
  - Local Populace (if aware): -Minor (fear/dislike)

## Branching Paths
- Choose violent confrontation versus intimidation or negotiation with the prospectors.
- Choose whether to betray the Cartel by helping the prospectors, warning them, or stealing the claim.
- Decide whether to report the discovery of a richer deposit to the Cartel, the Prospectors' Union, or keep it secret.
- Decide how much force is 'necessary'.

## Optional Content

- Gather evidence of the Cartel's brutal methods to potentially expose them later to authorities or rival factions.
- Hunt dangerous Amber Forest creatures that may be harassing both Cartel patrols and prospectors.
