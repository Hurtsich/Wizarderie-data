## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Investigation, Collection, Dungeon Crawl
- **Difficulty:** Medium-Hard
- **Estimated Duration:** 3-5 hours

## Description
Strange afflictions are affecting Bellyport citizens exposed to unusual bioluminescent fungi from the deeper Grottos. Scholar Seraphina Deepdelver, consulting for the Watchers, needs samples of the mutated fungus and environmental readings from its source.

## Prerequisites
- Access to Bellyport
- Neutral or higher reputation with The Titan Watchers' Confederacy OR personal connection to Seraphina Deepdelver

**Failure Conditions:**
- Player party succumbs to the sickness and requires rescue/cure.
- Samples are contaminated, destroyed, or lost.
- Scanner is lost or broken beyond repair.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Return with partial data or slightly contaminated samples (lesser reward, research takes longer).
