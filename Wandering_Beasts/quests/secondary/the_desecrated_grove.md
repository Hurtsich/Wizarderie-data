# The Desecrated Grove

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Investigation, Combat, Ritual
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Estimated Duration:** 2-4 hours

## Description
Shell-Priestess Vesper Scalebright of the Order of the Sacred Shell is deeply troubled by reports of a sacred grove deep within the Whispering Chitin Forest being desecrated. Strange symbols have been carved into ancient chitin trees, and the local Titan flora and fauna are agitated and hostile. She asks the players to investigate the source, cleanse the site, and restore balance.

## Prerequisites
- Access to Shellgarden or the Whispering Chitin Forest region
- Neutral or higher reputation with the Order of the Sacred Shell

## Objectives
### Travel to the specified sacred grove within the Whispering Chitin Forest. Investigate the desecration: identify the strange symbols, track the culprits if possible, and understand the nature of the disturbance. Deal with any agitated or corrupted flora/fauna guarding the grove. Perform a cleansing ritual according to Vesper's instructions, possibly involving specific natural components found nearby or specific harmonious actions.

**Success Conditions:**
- Grove thoroughly investigated and source of desecration identified (or culprits dealt with).
- Cleansing ritual successfully performed, calming the immediate area.
- Return to Vesper with findings and confirmation of cleansing.

**Failure Conditions:**
- The grove becomes permanently corrupted due to player actions or failure to stop the source.
- Players fail the ritual requirements (e.g., destroying key components, performing actions incorrectly).
- Key ritual components are lost or destroyed before use.
- Party is overwhelmed by corrupted guardians.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Identify the culprits as Cult of the Sleeper agents performing a dark ritual (leads to potential conflict/further investigation).
- Discover the desecration was unintentional pollution or side-effect from nearby hidden activity (e.g., illegal logging, chemical dumping).
- The ritual only partially cleanses the grove, requiring further action or rarer components.
- Convince minor nature spirits (if applicable) angered by the desecration to aid in the cleansing.

## Key NPCs
- Vesper Scalebright (Shell-Priestess, Quest Giver)
- Lyra Webspinner (Master Weaver, May know safe paths through the forest)
- Cult of the Sleeper acolytes (Potential antagonists if involved)
- Willow Mossbeard (Master Herbalist, may be consulted about corrupted flora)

## Key Locations
- Shellgarden (briefing/debriefing)
- The Whispering Chitin Forest (main area of operation)
- Specific Sacred Grove location (marked by ancient chitin formations)
- Potentially near Chitinholm or entrances to The Chitin Broodmother's Lair (source of corrupted creatures?)

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Blessing of the Sacred Shell (minor persistent buff, e.g., +1 AC vs. natural creatures, advantage on saves vs. Titan poisons), Ornate Ceremonial Chime crafted from fossilized shell.
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Collection of rare, purified herbs and chitin samples from the cleansed grove.
  - Significant favor and trust from the Order of the Sacred Shell.
  - Small donation of supplies from Shellgarden community.
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - Finding a hidden cache left by previous Order guardians containing scrolls or minor relics.
  - Learning a fragment of Titan calming techniques or prayers from Vesper's ritual instructions.
  - Acquiring a piece of unique, uncorrupted iridescent chitin shed within the grove.
  - Discovering tracks leading to a previously unknown Cultist hideout or illegal operation.
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Order of the Sacred Shell: +Significant
  - Cult of the Sleeper: -Moderate (if identified and thwarted)
  - Shellgarden Populace: +Minor (reassured by grove cleansing)
  - Veridian Preservation Society: +Minor (if pollution source identified)

## Branching Paths
- Decide how to deal with culprits if found (capture for the Order, kill, drive off, try to reason with?).
- Decide whether to report findings about Cult activity or pollution to other potentially interested factions (Titan Watchers, Spinecrest Collective).
- Choose methods for dealing with corrupted guardians (lethal force, non-lethal calming techniques taught by Vesper?).

## Optional Content
- Collect samples of the corrupted flora/fauna for analysis by Willow Mossbeard or the Alchemists' Circle.
- Map the trails around the sacred grove and identify other points of interest or danger for the Cartographers' Society.
- Attempt to calm agitated wildlife in the surrounding forest non-lethally using knowledge gained from the ritual.
