# The Trembling Peaks Sensor Array

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Deployment, Exploration, Combat
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Estimated Duration:** 2-4 hours

## Description
Elder Speaker Theron Stonehand requires assistance deploying advanced seismic sensors in the unstable Crystal Spine Peaks to better predict tremors threatening Ridgehaven. Hostile creatures and treacherous terrain make the task perilous.

## Prerequisites
- Access to Ridgehaven
- Neutral or higher reputation with The Titan Watchers' Confederacy

## Objectives
### Travel to three specific locations high in the Crystal Spine Peaks, clear any immediate threats, and install seismic sensors provided by Theron Stonehand.

**Success Conditions:**
- All three sensors deployed and activated.
- Return activation codes to Theron Stonehand.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Player party wiped out.
- Sensors destroyed before deployment.
- Losing Theron Stonehand's trust (e.g., by abandoning the mission).

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Only one or two sensors deployed (partial reward/success, reduced data accuracy).
- Sensors deployed in slightly different, safer locations due to overwhelming danger (data less accurate, Theron slightly disappointed but still pays).

## Key NPCs
- Theron Stonehand (Elder Speaker, Quest Giver)
- Kaelen Ridgeclimber (High Climber Aspirant, Potential guide/local expert)

## Key Locations
- Ridgehaven
- The Crystal Spine Peaks (specific peaks near Crystal Vein Mines entrance)
- The Ancient Climb-Way

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Masterwork Climbing Gear: High-quality ropes, pitons, and harness providing bonuses to climbing checks.
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Gold payment (scaled by number of sensors deployed).
  - Map of surveyed peaks with hazard markings provided by Theron.
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - Discovering a rare, piezoelectric crystal cluster near one deployment site.
  - Finding a lost Ridge Runner Federation patrol logbook hinting at unreported Deepwell Mining Consortium activity in the area.
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - The Titan Watchers' Confederacy: +Significant
  - Ridge Runner Federation: +Minor (if logbook returned or dangers reported)

## Branching Paths
- Decide whether to investigate the lost logbook further, potentially leading to conflict or cooperation with the Ridge Runner Federation or the Deepwell Mining Consortium.
- Decide whether to report the crystal cluster (potential reward from Prospectors' Union, but could attract unwanted Consortium attention) or keep it secret.

## Optional Content
- Rescue Kaelen Ridgeclimber if he attempts the climb solo and gets into trouble.
- Map unexplored cave systems encountered during deployment for the Cartographers' Society.
- Collect samples of unusual alpine flora for the Herbalists' Guild.
