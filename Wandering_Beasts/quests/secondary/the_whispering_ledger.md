# The Whispering Ledger

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Stealth, Heist, Intrigue
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Estimated Duration:** 2-3 hours

## Description
A discreet contact affiliated with the Whisper Network needs skilled operatives to acquire a specific ledger containing sensitive shipping manifests from a mid-level Sky-Traders' Concordat official based in Plateau Market. Acquisition must be silent; the Syndicate's involvement must remain absolutely hidden. Payment is generous for success and silence.

## Prerequisites
- Access to Plateau Market
- Contact established with a Horizon Syndicate agent or intermediary (perhaps via the Whisper Network or a seemingly unrelated underworld figure)
- Reputation with Syndicate likely neutral or unknown; willingness to perform covert actions

## Objectives
### Infiltrate the target Concordat official's office or private residence within the bustling Plateau Market district, preferably during a busy market day, festival, or shift change for cover. Locate and steal the specific ledger described by the contact without being detected by guards, wards, or the official. Leave no trace of entry or theft. Deliver the ledger to the Syndicate contact at a pre-arranged dead-drop or meeting.

**Success Conditions:**
- The correct ledger successfully stolen.
- Ledger delivered to the Syndicate contact.
- No alarms raised during or immediately after the theft.
- Syndicate connection remains hidden.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Getting caught by guards or the official during infiltration or theft.
- Raising a Concordat security alarm.
- Losing the ledger after stealing it.
- Leaving evidence directly linking the players or the Syndicate to the crime.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Steal the wrong ledger (contact is displeased, offers significantly reduced or no reward).
- Obtain the correct ledger but leave traceable evidence (Syndicate is unhappy, may try to silence players, Concordat investigation targets players).
- Successfully copy the ledger's key contents instead of stealing the physical book (requires specific skills/tools; contact may accept this with minor displeasure).
- Use the ledger as leverage against the Syndicate or the Concordat official.

## Key NPCs
- Whisper Agent contact ('Nadia Quickstep' - perhaps Silas's shadier sibling?, or a disguised agent using an alias)
- Concordat Official Darian Cloudgazer (Target, meticulous, perhaps involved in minor smuggling)
- Plateau Lord Hadrian Platewalker (His guards are the security obstacle)
- Brynn Amberheart (Tavern Owner, potential source of rumors about the official's habits)

## Key Locations
- Plateau Market (Concordat Trade Office, Official's Residence, Rooftops, Alleyways)
- Hidden meeting spot or dead-drop location for delivery (e.g., abandoned stall, specific sewer grate).

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Significant payment in untraceable currency (e.g., high-value gemstones, foreign coinage) or rare illicit goods, Access code/password for future, higher-level Syndicate communications or contacts.
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Set of masterwork thieves' tools or specialized infiltration gear.
  - Map showing hidden routes, guard patrols, or smuggling tunnels within Plateau Market.
  - A 'clean' identity document useful for bypassing minor checkpoints.
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - Finding incriminating personal letters or blackmail material alongside the ledger in the official's safe.
  - Discovering the ledger contains coded messages detailing illegal Syndicate arms shipments or movements of rival gangs (e.g., Black Chitin Ring).
  - Identifying the official's own smuggling contacts from notes within the ledger.
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - The Horizon Syndicate: +Moderate (if successful & discreet)
  - Sky-Traders' Concordat: -Significant (if caught or linked)
  - Plateau Market Guard: -Minor (if caught or investigation begins)

## Branching Paths
- Choose method of infiltration: pure stealth, disguise and social engineering, creating a distraction.
- Decide whether to read the ledger's sensitive contents before delivery, risking discovery or Syndicate suspicion.
- Decide whether to betray the Syndicate by giving the ledger (or copies) to the Concordat, Spinecrest Collective, or another interested party.
- Choose how to deal with unexpected witnesses or guards (avoid, neutralize non-lethally, eliminate?).

## Optional Content
- Frame a known local thief or rival smuggler for the theft.
- Disable security measures (traps, alarms) non-lethally and without leaving obvious signs.
- Gather additional blackmail material on the Concordat official unrelated to the ledger for personal use.
- Plant a listening device in the official's office for the Syndicate (or personal use).
