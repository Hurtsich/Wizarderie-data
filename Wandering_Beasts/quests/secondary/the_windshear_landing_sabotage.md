# The Windshear Landing Sabotage

## Type and Difficulty
- **Type:** Investigation, Stealth, Social Interaction
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Estimated Duration:** 3-4 hours

## Description
Guildmistress Linnea Windrider of the Sky-Shipwrights' Union suspects sabotage is crippling operations at Windshear Landing. Recent 'accidents' with mooring clamps and lift mechanisms seem too coincidental. Investigate discreetly and identify the culprit.

## Prerequisites
- Access to Windshear Landing
- Neutral reputation with Sky-Shipwrights' Union OR Sky-Traders' Concordat

## Objectives
### Gather clues by interviewing disgruntled dockworkers, examining accident sites for tampering (requires technical/investigation skills), observing shift changes, and surveilling suspicious individuals. Identify the saboteur and provide concrete proof to Linnea Windrider.

**Success Conditions:**
- Identify the saboteur(s).
- Provide concrete evidence (e.g., sabotage tools, witness testimony, incriminating documents) to Linnea Windrider.

**Failure Conditions:**
- Alerting the saboteur(s) causing them to flee or destroy evidence.
- Accusing the wrong person, damaging Linnea's trust.
- Getting caught snooping by Landing security and implicating Linnea or the Union.
- The saboteur causes a major incident (e.g., ship crash) due to player inaction/failure.

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- Identify the saboteur but lack concrete proof (partial reward, Linnea is frustrated but may act on suspicion).
- Uncover evidence linking the sabotage to the Horizon Syndicate, the Black Chitin Ring, or a rival trading company (opens new questlines).
- The saboteur offers the players a bribe to look the other way or frame someone else.

## Key NPCs
- Linnea Windrider (Guildmistress, Quest Giver)
- Orin Mistwalker (Sky-Trader Captain, Potential informant, dislikes Concordat bureaucracy but hates sabotage affecting independents)
- Silas Quickstep (Network Courier, Could have seen something suspicious during deliveries)

## Key Locations
- Windshear Landing (Dockyards, Maintenance Tunnels, Lift Platforms, Crew Taverns)
- Sky-Shipwrights' Union HQ
- Potentially The Skyship Graveyard (if parts are being stolen/sabotaged)

## Rewards
- **Primary Reward:** Significant discount on future sky-ship repairs or upgrades at the Union dockyard, Letter of commendation from Guildmistress Windrider.
- **Secondary Rewards:**
  - Significant gold payment.
  - Set of fine Shipwright's or Mechanic's tools.
- **Hidden Rewards:**
  - Recovering stolen advanced ship components (e.g., experimental stabilizers) valuable to the Union.
  - Finding a coded message implicating a higher authority within a rival faction or the Syndicate.
  - Map of hidden maintenance accessways in Windshear Landing.
- **Reputation Impact:**
  - Sky-Shipwrights' Union: +Significant
  - Sky-Traders' Concordat: +Moderate (as stability benefits them)
  - Horizon Syndicate: -Minor (if they are involved and exposed)
  - Windshear Landing Security: +Minor (if cooperation occurs)

## Branching Paths
- Decide whether to apprehend the saboteur directly, perhaps leading to combat or a chase, or report to Linnea first.
- Decide whether to accept a bribe or offer from the saboteur.
- Choose how to follow up on evidence linking the sabotage to external factions (report to Linnea, investigate independently, sell info).

## Optional Content
- Prevent another sabotage attempt while it is in progress.
- Plant evidence to frame someone else (dark path with potential consequences).
- Gather rumors from dockworkers about unrelated matters (other quest hooks).
