# Chronicles of the Wandering Titans

## Description
Civilization isn't built on land, but upon the colossal, slowly wandering backs of continent-sized, ancient creatures known as Titans. Each Titan hosts unique ecosystems, cultures, and resources, making travel between them by precarious sky-ship or perilous climb a necessity for trade, war, and survival as the Titans themselves sometimes stir.

## Physical World
The known world consists of the surfaces, interiors, and immediate sky-space surrounding several continent-sized, biomechanical or bio-geological creatures known as Titans.

### Details
Each Titan possesses unique geography formed from its body: mountain ranges are spinal ridges (The Crystal Spine Peaks), forests grow on shed chitin or thick hide (The Whispering Chitin Forest), deserts form on sun-baked plates (The Scalemail Desert), and swamps fester in damp underbellies (The Underbelly Swamps). Climate varies drastically based on altitude on the Titan, its position relative to the sun, and internal geothermal activity. The space between Titans (The Cloudshear Archipelago) is a hazardous void filled with turbulent winds, strange sky-beasts, and floating debris.

### Impact
Survival depends entirely on understanding and adapting to the specific Titan's environment and movements. Geography dictates settlement patterns, resource availability, and travel routes. The constant, slow movement of Titans forces cultures to be adaptable or nomadic, and interaction between Titans is perilous but necessary for resource diversity.

## Cultural Elements
Cultures are shaped by the specific Titan they inhabit and their methods of survival and interaction.

### Details
Languages often incorporate terms specific to Titan anatomy, movement ('deep-tremor', 'crest-shift'), and the unique flora/fauna ('chitin-crab', 'sporebloom'). Customs revolve around the Titan's cycles, with rituals for safe passage, appeasing the 'spirit' of the Titan (real or perceived), and honouring those lost to falls or Titan movements. Traditions include intricate knot-tying for climbing, sky-charting for navigation between Titans, and oral histories recounting past migrations and encounters.

### Impact
Shared customs and language variations create distinct cultural identities on each Titan or even different regions of the same Titan. Inter-Titan relations range from cooperative trade alliances to fierce rivalries based on differing beliefs (worshipping vs. exploiting Titans) and resource competition. Traditions reinforce community bonds and pass down essential survival knowledge.

## Social Structures
Societies are often hierarchical, based on control over vital resources, locations, and inter-Titan travel.

### Details
A distinct class system exists in many settlements. At the top are Sky-Captains, Plateau Lords, powerful Guildmasters (controlling trade/craft), and Shell-Priests interpreting the Titan's 'will'. Below them are skilled labourers like climbers, pilots, artisans, and Titan resource harvesters. The lowest strata include manual labourers in hazardous areas (like the Underbelly Swamps or mines) and outcasts living in marginal zones like Gullytown.

### Impact
Power dynamics are centered around controlling strategic locations (e.g., Sky-Docks, mountain passes like Windhowl Pass), resource nodes (Ambervein, Crystal Vein Mines), and the means of travel (sky-ships controlled by the Sky-Traders' Concordat or powerful factions). Social mobility often depends on mastering essential skills (climbing, navigation, crafting) or joining influential factions.

## Economic Systems
Economies are primarily based on harvesting Titan-derived resources and inter-Titan trade.

### Details
Key resources include chitin, hardened shell plates, bioluminescent fungi, rare minerals mined from Titan interiors (Ambervein), geothermal energy, unique flora/fauna, and salvaged materials from ancient structures or downed sky-ships. Trade occurs within Titans (e.g., Plateau Market) and, more lucratively but dangerously, between Titans via armed sky-ships operated by groups like the Sky-Traders' Concordat. Currency varies, often using standardized ingots of rare Titan minerals, processed chitin, or barter based on essential goods.

### Impact
Resource distribution is uneven, driving exploration, trade, and conflict. Control over valuable resource nodes or trade routes grants significant economic and political power (e.g., Deepwell Mining Consortium, Amber Vein Cartel). The scarcity of certain materials fuels innovation in crafting and technology, particularly in sky-ship design and resource extraction.

## Everyday Life
Daily life is a constant negotiation with the environment of the living Titan.

### Details
Common jobs include farming hardy Titan-surface crops or fungal gardens, hunting/taming Titan parasites or surface creatures, mining minerals or harvesting chitin, crafting tools and shelter from Titan materials, piloting or crewing sky-ships, and guarding settlements/caravans. Hobbies might involve collecting rare fossils, competitive climbing, sky-fishing, storytelling, or intricate shell carving. Daily routines are often dictated by the Titan's minor movements, weather patterns specific to the Titan's altitude, and the need for constant maintenance of structures and equipment.

### Impact
Life requires resilience, specialized skills, and a strong sense of community for survival. Danger is ever-present, from environmental hazards like sudden tremors or toxic spores to hostile creatures and rival groups. The unique environment shapes everything from architecture (often semi-mobile or easily repaired) to diet and clothing.

### The Great Migration
**Impact:** A period where several Titans moved in close proximity, allowing for unprecedented cultural exchange, trade, and conflict between populations.
**Significance:** Led to the formation of alliances (like early versions of the Confederacy/Concordat) and lasting rivalries. Spread technologies like basic sky-sailing.
### The Sky-Sail Breakthrough
**Impact:** Development of reliable sky-ships capable of navigating the Cloudshear Archipelago, revolutionizing inter-Titan trade and warfare.
**Significance:** Enabled the rise of factions like the Sky-Traders' Concordat and Sky-Pirates; shifted power towards those controlling sky-faring technology.
### The Spine War
**Impact:** A major conflict between factions vying for control of a Titan's strategic dorsal ridge (likely involving proto-Spinecrest factions).
**Significance:** Solidified the importance of high-ground territory and led to advancements in Titan-surface warfare and fortifications.
### Discovery of the Deep Vents
**Impact:** Explorers discovered geothermal vents deep within a Titan, unlocking a new energy source and valuable minerals.
**Significance:** Led to the founding of Deepwell and the rise of mining consortiums, creating new wealth but also environmental concerns.
### The Chitin Plague
**Impact:** A virulent disease or parasitic outbreak spread through contaminated chitin, devastating several settlements.
**Significance:** Led to stricter quarantine procedures, advances in medicine/alchemy, and distrust of certain chitin sources or infested regions (like the Parasite Blightlands).
### The Fall of Aethel
**Impact:** A legendary flying city or sky-platform reportedly crashed or was brought down, its location and secrets now lost.
**Significance:** Became a cautionary tale and a lure for treasure hunters seeking its ruins (perhaps related to the Skyship Graveyard or Sunken Library of Aethel).
### The Awakening of 'Old Thunder'
**Impact:** A normally dormant Titan stirred violently, causing massive earthquakes, reshaping its surface geography ('The Great Scar'), and destroying settlements.
**Significance:** Reinforced the danger and unpredictability of the Titans; spurred study into Titan behavior (Titan Watchers) and worship (Cult of the Sleeper).
### Formation of the Concordat
**Impact:** Major sky-trading families and fleets united to form the Sky-Traders' Concordat, standardizing routes and dominating inter-Titan commerce.
**Significance:** Brought relative stability to sky-trade but concentrated immense economic power, leading to resentment and rivalry.
### The Rise of the Amber Cartel
**Impact:** A ruthless group seized control of the newly discovered Ambervein region, establishing a lucrative and brutal monopoly.
**Significance:** Demonstrated how control over a single, rare resource could create a powerful, independent faction operating outside traditional structures.
### The Schism of the Shell
