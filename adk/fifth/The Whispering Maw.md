# The Whispering Maw
**Description**: The Whispering Maw is a colossal caldera etched into the living rock of Titan Aethelred, serving as the profound spiritual heart of The Titan's Chosen. It constantly emits deep, resonant vibrations that are felt more than heard, permeating the very air. The caldera is frequently shrouded in an ethereal, bioluminescent mist, which glows with shifting hues, lending the entire sanctuary a mystical and otherworldly ambiance. It is within these depths that The Chosen seek direct communion with the Titan's essence.
