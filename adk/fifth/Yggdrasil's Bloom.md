# Yggdrasil's Bloom
**Description**: A colossal, ancient serpentine Titan, its entire body a living forest. Its 'scales' are vast, fertile plains overgrown with ancient, bioluminescent trees reaching thousands of feet tall, interlocked by a dense canopy. Rivers cascade from its joints like waterfalls, forming verdant valleys on its back. The air is thick with humidity and the scent of rich soil and exotic flora. Deep chasms and hollowed-out sections of its body lead into its mysterious interior, forming vast cave systems known as the Underbloom. The ecosystem is dominated by colossal flora, unique airborne fauna, and complex fungal networks.
