  "name": "Aerie-Dock 7",
  "description": "Aerie-Dock 7 is a colossal, bustling inter-Titan sky-ship port, a marvel of engineering and necessity, constructed upon a series of magically buoyant, interconnected rock fragments and ancient, giant metallic platforms. These platforms are securely tethered by colossal chains and energy conduits to the edge of an exceptionally high, broad, and unusually stable plateau on the Titan Auroch, known as 'Auroch's Shoulder'. It hangs precariously in the sky, a sprawling city of docking towers that pierce the clouds, sprawling repair bays echoing with the clang of hammers, vibrant multicultural trading posts overflowing with exotic goods, and raucous taverns filled with sky-farers from every known Titan. The air crackles with energy â€“ from the hum of the buoyancy engines to the shouts of dockworkers and the babble of a dozen languages. Sky-ships of every conceivable design, from sleek Aerionite clippers to lumbering Ignis ore-haulers and elegant Chelonian trade barges, constantly arrive and depart, their mooring lines like metallic spiderwebs against the breathtaking backdrop of distant, colossal Titans lumbering across the horizon. The views from the edge of the platforms are vertiginous and awe-inspiring, offering a constant reminder of the dock's sky-high, precarious existence.",
  "geography": {
    "region": "Tethered to 'Auroch's Shoulder,' a high, stable plateau on the Titan Auroch, bordering The Verdant Spine.",
    "landscape": "A sprawling complex of interconnected, artificially buoyant rock and metal platforms of varying sizes and altitudes, linked by suspension bridges, grav-lifts, and ziplines. Massive docking towers, some hundreds of meters tall, dominate the skyline. Repair bays are often built into the undersides of larger platforms or within hollowed-out rock fragments. The entire structure is anchored by immense, magically reinforced chains and energy tethers to the plateau's cliffs.",
    "climate": "High-altitude temperate. Often windy, with strong updrafts from Auroch's respiration and movement. Cloud cover frequently envelops the lower sections of the dock. Temperatures can be cool, especially at night or when Auroch passes through colder atmospheric layers. Magically maintained atmospheric shields offer some protection in core areas.",
