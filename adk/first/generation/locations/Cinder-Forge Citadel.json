  "name": "Cinder-Forge Citadel",
  "description": "Cinder-Forge Citadel is a heavily fortified, sprawling industrial metropolis carved into the volatile slopes of a major volcano system within the Cinder-Heart Caldera on the Titan Ignis. Renowned across the Titans for its peerless master smiths and the relentless exploitation of geothermal power and unique volcanic metals, the city is a grim testament to harsh necessity and indomitable will. Its formidable architecture, constructed from black obsidian, basalt, and dark, volcanic rock, features massive, angular bulwarks, reinforced causeways, and ingenious channels designed to withstand Ignis's frequent, violent tremors and to redirect or contain surging lava flows. The skyline is dominated by the colossal silhouettes of the Great Forges, each powered directly by roaring volcanic vents, which continuously belch acrid smoke, scalding steam, and incandescent embers into the ash-choked sky, creating a perpetual, fiery twilight. The inhabitants – primarily hardy Ashari, resilient Deep Dwarves, and stoic Forged Constructs – are tough, resourceful, and grimly accustomed to constant peril, their lives a continuous cycle of labor and vigilance to maintain their city against the unpredictable, fiery whims of the Titan Ignis.",
  "geography": {
    "region": "Located within the Cinder-Heart Caldera on the Titan Ignis, built upon and around a network of active volcanic vents and stable lava tubes.",
    "landscape": "A multi-level city built into the volcanic rock, featuring obsidian-faced fortifications, deep-channelled lava moats (some active, some diversionary), vast, cavernous forge-complexes, and densely packed, heat-resistant dwellings. Geothermal vents are integrated directly into industrial sectors. Reinforced tunnels and magma-proof gates connect various districts.",
    "climate": "Extreme heat, thick with volcanic ash and sulfurous fumes, necessitating respiratory protection in many areas. Frequent, sometimes violent, seismic tremors are a part of daily life. The glow of lava and forges creates an oppressive, fiery ambiance. Localized atmospheric scrubbers provide pockets of more breathable air in residential and commercial zones.",
