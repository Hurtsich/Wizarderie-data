  "name": "Frostfell Outpost",
  "description": "Frostfell Outpost is a resilient and isolated settlement carved directly into the glacial ice of the Titan Kryos, strategically positioned near a cluster of powerful geothermal vents. These vents are the lifeblood of the community, providing essential heat and energy that ward off the extreme cold. The architecture is compact and heavily insulated, often utilizing salvaged materials from ancient structures found frozen in the ice or from wrecked sky-ships. Buildings are dug into the ice or constructed with thick walls of reinforced ice-crete, designed to withstand Kryos's frequent blizzards and terrifying ice quakes. The outpost hums with a quiet determination, its inhabitants a mix of rugged survivalists, shrewd traders specializing in rare Kryosian ice-crystals, and intrepid researchers dedicated to studying the unique properties of the Titan and its frozen secrets. Visible signs of adaptation to the harsh environment are everywhere, from steaming thermal conduits running between structures to sturdy ice-fishing huts over boreholes, and the glowing, enclosed biodomes where precious, hardy crops are cultivated under artificial light.",
  "geography": {
    "region": "Located on a relatively stable ice plateau within The Shifting Ice Plains of Kryos, nestled around a significant geothermal vent cluster known as 'Kryos's Hearth'.",
    "landscape": "A mix of structures carved directly into glacial ice walls, subterranean tunnels reinforced with ice and salvaged metal, and insulated surface buildings made from salvaged plating and compacted snow-ice. Steaming vents and thermal pipes are prominent. The outpost is often surrounded by jagged ice formations and deep snowdrifts.",
    "climate": "Locally moderated arctic conditions due to geothermal activity, but still subject to extreme cold (temperatures regularly drop below -60Â°C away from vents), frequent blizzards with low visibility, and sudden ice quakes caused by Kryos's movements. The air is thin and biting.",
