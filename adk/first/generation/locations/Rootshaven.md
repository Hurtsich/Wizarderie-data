# Rootshaven
**Description**: Rootshaven is an ancient city deeply interwoven with the colossal, exposed root systems of the Titanwood trees that flourish upon Auroch's back. More grown than built, its structures are carved into the living flesh of massive roots, while homes and workshops nestle within their protective embrace. Living branches, carefully guided over centuries, form sturdy, swaying bridges connecting different levels of the city, from the dimly lit under-roots where bioluminescent fungi cast an ethereal glow, to airy platforms built high in the lower canopy. The culture of Rootshaven is one of profound reverence for Auroch and the intricate ecosystem it supports; every aspect of life, from architecture to governance, is guided by a deep respect for the natural world. The city itself seems to breathe with the forest, its inhabitants accustomed to the gentle, perpetual sway of the Titanwood trees and the slow, ponderous movements of Auroch beneath them. It feels less like a settlement imposed upon the landscape and more like a natural, ancient symbiosis between people and Titan-flora.

## Geography
**Region**: Located within a vast, ancient grove in The Verdant Spine of Auroch, specifically in a region known as a 'Great Rootvale'.
**Landscape**: A multi-tiered city built vertically within and around the interwoven root systems of several colossal Titanwood trees. The 'Lower Boles' consist of hollows and chambers at ground level and just beneath, often extending into the rich earth around the roots. The 'Root-Lattice' forms the city's heart, a labyrinthine network of dwellings carved directly into the massive, exposed roots. 'Branch-Walks' and 'Canopy Commons' are higher up, consisting of platforms and structures built amidst the lower canopy, connected by living bridges and reinforced vines. Natural springs originating from Auroch sometimes pool in root hollows, providing fresh water.
**Climate**: Humid and temperate, heavily shaded by the dense Titanwood canopy. Light is often dappled or dim, supplemented by cultivated bioluminescent flora. The city experiences a constant, gentle swaying motion from the trees and the underlying Titan, which the inhabitants have adapted to. Mist often clings to the lower levels in the cooler parts of Auroch's day-cycle.
**Key Features**:
- The Elder-Root (the largest, central root system housing the main council chambers and oldest structures)
- The Living Bridge Network (an intricate system of grown branch-bridges)
- Glow-Moss Caverns (under-root areas naturally lit by vibrant mosses)
- The Canopy Market (a bustling platform market high in the trees)
- The Whispering Grove (a sacred area where the rustling leaves are said to convey Auroch's will)
- Sun-Dapple Terraces (small, open-air cultivation spots in the canopy)
**Points Of Interest**:
- The Shrine of the First Sprout
- Root-Shapers' Guildhall
- The Swaying Kettle Tavern
- The Archives of Bark and Leaf (knowledge recorded on natural materials)
- The Weavers' Nook (where intricate vine and fiber crafts are made)
- The Silent Pools (reflective pools used for scrying and meditation)
**Threats**:
- Root-shifts during significant Titan Quakes (from Auroch's movement)
- falling branches or debris from the upper canopy
- canopy fires (rare but devastating)
- infestations of wood-boring Titan-insects
- territorial forest creatures intruding from the deeper woods
- overgrowth if not carefully managed
- getting lost in the unlit, deeper root tunnels

## Demographics
**Population**: Approximately 15,000, with a stable and deeply rooted community.
**Typical Inhabitants**:
- Sylvans (the majority, with an innate ability to shape and communicate with wood)
- Forest Humans (generations adapted to arboreal life, often druidic)
- Grovetenders (a spiritual class dedicated to maintaining the health of the Titanwood and interpreting Auroch's signs)
- Mosslings (small, sapient plant-like beings)
- visiting traders from other Aurochian settlements

## Government
**Type**: Gerontocracy combined with a Druidic Council. Wisdom, age, and attunement to nature are highly valued.
**Ruling Power**: The Circle of Elders, comprised of the oldest and most respected Sylvans and Grovetenders. Decisions are made through lengthy deliberation and what is perceived as consensus with the 'will of the forest'. The Head Root-Shaper holds considerable practical authority regarding city maintenance and growth.

## Economy
**Description**: Primarily based on sustainable arboriculture, masterful woodcrafting, herbalism, the cultivation of specialized fungi and symbiotic plants, and careful foraging. Rootshaven prides itself on its self-sufficiency and harmonious resource management. Trade is conducted with a focus on balance and mutual benefit.
**Main Exports**:
- Intricately carved living wood items (furniture, tools, art)
- potent medicinal herbs and poultices unique to the Titanwood ecosystem
- bioluminescent moss cultures
- rare Titanwood seeds and saplings
- Sylvan-woven textiles from tree silks and fibers
- artisanal fungal brews
**Main Imports**:
- Metal tools and raw metals (smelting is difficult and discouraged within the living city)
- stone for grinding and specialized construction
- salt
- durable fabrics from outside the forest
- sky-ship components for their few long-distance traders
- exotic fruits or grains not cultivable in the deep shade

## History
**Significance**: Rootshaven is considered one of the oldest Sylvan settlements on Auroch, a living testament to their philosophy of co-existence with the Titan. It's a center of ancient wisdom concerning Titanwood lore, natural magic, and symbiotic living. Many on Auroch look to Rootshaven for guidance on ecological matters.
**Notable Events**:
- The Great Root-Binding (the legendary founding of the city, when the first Sylvans guided the roots to form habitable spaces)
- The Song of Growth (a period of magical expansion and prosperity)
- The Withering Plague (a blight that threatened the city, overcome by collective druidic effort)
- The Day Auroch Danced (a series of unusually strong Titan Quakes that led to significant rebuilding and a renewed reverence for Auroch's power)
- The Arrival of the Sky-Traders (marking Rootshaven's cautious entry into inter-Titan commerce via Aerie-Dock 7)
