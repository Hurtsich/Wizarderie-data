  "name": "The Shifting Ice Plains of Kryos",
  "description": "A desolate and expansive arctic zone on the back of the Titan Kryos. The landscape is dominated by vast glaciers, deep crevasses, jagged ice mountains, and frozen rivers. The ice itself is not static; it groans, shifts, and reforms due to the Titan's movements and sub-glacial geothermal activity. Evidence of ancient, colossal life forms, some reptilian, others insectoid, are often found perfectly preserved within the translucent depths of the ice. The atmosphere is frigid and unforgiving, with biting winds carrying razor-sharp ice crystals. Unique, towering crystalline ice formations, glowing with an internal light, dot the landscape. Kryos's own biological processes generate stunning, multi-hued auroral displays that dance perpetually in the dark skies, casting an eerie and beautiful light upon the frozen wastes.",
