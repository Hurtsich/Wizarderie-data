  "name": "The Verdant Spine of Auroch",
  "description": "A vast, continent-like region forming the primary 'back' of the Titan Auroch. This region is characterized by ancient, colossal forests of Titanwood trees that scrape the sky, mountain ranges formed by Auroch's immense bony protrusions (the \"Spinal Spires\"), and deep, fertile valleys carved by millennia of movement and the Titan's own biological processes. The sheer scale is breathtaking, with a palpable sense of a living, breathing landscape; the ground subtly shifts, the air hums with the Titan's respiration, and distant rumbles signify its slow, ponderous gait. Ancient ruins, partially reclaimed by nature, dot the landscape, hinting at forgotten civilizations that once thrived here. The ecosystem is incredibly rich, teeming with unique flora such as bioluminescent fungi illuminating the forest floor and giant, motile pitcher plants. Fauna includes herds of six-legged grazers, colossal insects like the iridescent Titan Beetles, and apex predators adapted to hunting in the dense, ever-shifting forests. Symbiotic relationships are common, with many creatures and plants having evolved to depend directly on Auroch's physiology or the unique conditions it creates.",
