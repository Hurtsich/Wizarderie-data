# Aethelwood Spire-City
**Description**: A vibrant, multi-tiered city built directly into the colossal, petrified bark and living flora covering the back of 'Yggdrasil,' the Verdant Colossus. Its districts spiral upwards along ancient, tree-like structures, culminating in research spires and observation decks amidst the high canopy. Known for its bio-luminescent gardens, thriving exotic ecosystems, and the deep reverence of its elven and fey-touched inhabitants for their living host. A center for herbalism, nature magic, and sustainable living, it's also a primary port for skiffs that harvest dew and rare sky-fruits from the misty altitudes.
