# Port Azurea
**Description**: A bustling, multi-level port city built along the 'shell-rim' of 'Shelldon,' the Great Turtle Titan, where its colossal carapace dips into the true, boundless 'Titan-Sea' of the world. It is the primary nexus for deep-sea exploration and trade with the mysterious aquatic civilizations dwelling beneath the waves. Its docks are thronged with unique submersible vessels, grand airships designed for long-range voyages, and 'shell-skiffs' used by local fishers to harpoon titanic sky-fish. The city's lower levels are often submerged or affected by the Titan's slow, rhythmic dives, adding a layer of constant adaptation and resilience to its diverse population of sailors and merchants.


## Geography
**Region**: The Shell-Rim of Shelldon, where it meets the Titan-Sea

**Landscape**: A tiered city cascading down the colossal, barnacle-encrusted shell of Shelldon, with docks and structures extending into the deep ocean. Upper levels are open-air, while lower levels feature reinforced, watertight districts designed to withstand periodic submergence. Underwater sections are illuminated by bioluminescent fauna and specialized lighting.

**Climate**: Coastal and humid, dominated by salty sea breezes and the rhythmic sound of crashing waves. Temperatures are generally mild, but deep-sea currents can bring unexpected chills. The unique 'tides' are caused by Shelldon's slow, ponderous dives, leading to cyclical submergence of the lower city.

**Key Features**:
- The Outer Shell-Docks: Primary berths for airships and surface vessels, with a commanding view of the sky-sea.

- The Deepwater Bays: Cavernous, reinforced docks for submersible craft, often protected by arcane force fields or thick hydrostatic gates.

- The Submerged Districts (The Undercity): Lower levels designed to function underwater, with pressurized domes, specialized aquatic infrastructure, and bioluminescent gardens.

- The Tidal Stairwells: Grand, sloping ramps and elevators connecting the dry upper city to the submerged lower levels, often covered in sea growth.

- The Great Coral Reef (Titan-Sea Side): A vibrant, living coral reef growing off Shelldon's carapace, teeming with unique marine life and used by local fishers.

**Points Of Interest**:
- The Navigator's Roost: A prominent lighthouse and guildhall for deep-sea cartographers and long-range sky-navigators.

- The Leviathan Market: A bustling, open-air bazaar specializing in harvested sea-creature parts, unique pearls, and deep-sea minerals.

- The Sunken Grotto Inn: A popular tavern located in a perpetually submerged section, known for its unique 'bubble-beer' and panoramic underwater views.

- The Sahuagin Embassy: A heavily guarded and often tense diplomatic outpost for the enigmatic aquatic civilizations (or their proxies).

- The Shell-Skiff Yards: Docks dedicated to the specialized skiffs used for harvesting sky-fish and hunting surface-dwelling sea beasts.

**Threats**:
- Shelldon's unpredictable deep dives or sudden shifts, causing structural stress and massive 'tidal' waves.

- Aggressive deep-sea leviathans or territorial aquatic civilizations protecting their domains.

- Sky-pirates or rival merchant fleets attempting to raid shipping lanes or the port itself.

- Dangerous underwater currents, whirlpools, and abyssal fissures.

- Sabotage or espionage from rival deep-sea exploration guilds or political factions.

- The pressures and hazards of prolonged deep-sea travel or operation in submerged environments.


## Demographics
**Population**: Approximately 90,000 permanent residents, with a highly diverse, transient population of sailors, deep-sea explorers, and merchants that can swell the numbers significantly.

**Typical Inhabitants**:
- Humans (sailors, merchants, long-range explorers)

- Tritons (often serving as guides, interpreters for aquatic races, or deep-sea guards)

- Goliaths (strong, resilient deep-sea divers and laborers)

- Gnomes (submersible engineers, cartographers, inventors)

- Elves (often skilled at navigating the sky-sea or researching unique marine flora)

- Dwarves (providing reinforced construction and metalwork for submersibles)

- Various Aquatic Races (rarely, as diplomats or traders, often viewed with suspicion)


## Government
**Type**: Merchant Republic / Port Authority

**Ruling Power**: The 'Azure Conclave,' a council comprising the most influential deep-sea guild masters, major shipping magnates, and the highest-ranking naval commanders. Decisions are made through a blend of direct voting, trade agreements, and displays of economic/military power, often with a focus on maximizing profit and ensuring safe passage.


## Economy
**Description**: Port Azurea's economy is fundamentally maritime, driven by deep-sea exploration, trade with aquatic civilizations, and the harvesting of sea resources. It also serves as a crucial transit point for long-range sky-ship voyages, making it a hub for global trade and information.

**Main Exports**:
- Deep-sea minerals and unique alloys (often from submerged veins)

- Pearls, abyssal gems, and processed marine creature parts (e.g., leviathan oil, scales)

- Harvested sky-fish (from the surface of the Titan-Sea)

- Advanced submersible vessels and deep-sea exploration technology

- Hydro-potions, aquatic-adapted goods, and specialized navigational charts

**Main Imports**:
- Agricultural products and fresh water (though some desalinated locally)

- Metals and refined materials (from Ironhide Forges)

- Arcane components for shielding and propulsion (from Aethelwood or other sources)

- Manufactured goods, textiles, and luxury items from inland settlements

- Skilled labor, mercenary forces, and specialized engineers for ship maintenance


## History
**Significance**: Port Azurea is the vital gateway to the true ocean, providing the world with access to the mysteries and resources of the deep. It stands as a testament to the resilience and adaptability of civilizations living on and around colossal Titans, and is a key nexus for inter-Titan trade and exploration.

**Notable Events**:
- The Founding of the First Deep-Sea Docks (Epoch 250): Early settlements began to develop on Shelldon's rim, drawn by its unique position at the ocean's edge.

- The Discovery of the Aquatics (Epoch 580): First verifiable contact was made with a major aquatic civilization, opening up new trade routes and diplomatic challenges.

- The Great Pearl Rush (Epoch 910): A period of intense deep-sea exploration for valuable pearls, leading to rapid expansion and conflicts with indigenous marine life.

- The Submersible Wars (Epoch 1150-1155): Brief, intense conflicts between rival deep-sea guilds over prime exploration territories and resource claims.

- Shelldon's Deep Slumber (Epoch 1380): A prolonged period where Shelldon remained submerged longer than usual, testing the city's underwater resilience and leading to advancements in hydrostatic technology.


## Secrets
**Legends**:
- Shelldon's True Purpose: A legend claims Shelldon is not merely an animal, but a sentient guardian, carrying an ancient secret within its shell, perhaps a portal to a forgotten realm or the true origin of all Titans.

- The Sunken City of Azure: Whispers speak of an ancient, perfectly preserved city beneath Port Azurea, submerged by Shelldon's earliest dives, holding forgotten knowledge and unimaginable treasures.

- The Abyssal Heart: A tale of a pulsating, living core deep within the Titan-Sea, capable of granting immense power over water or revealing the true nature of the world's oceans.

**Artifacts**:
- The Kraken's Eye Compass: An ancient, crystalline device salvaged from the deep, said to always point to the largest concentration of deep-sea life or the nearest submersible vessel.

- Shelldon's Scale-Plate: A massive, magically enhanced scale believed to have naturally detached from Shelldon's carapace, granting its wielder extraordinary resilience and minor control over water.

- The Voice of the Deep: A legendary conch shell, when blown, is said to allow direct communication with certain deep-sea leviathans or even the 'thoughts' of the Titan-Sea itself.
