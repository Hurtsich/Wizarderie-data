# The Aerie Concord
**Description**: A sprawling mercantile guild known as the 'Aerie Concord' that controls the majority of aerial trade routes between habitable zones on different Titans. They utilize sophisticated, lighter-than-air sky-ships powered by refined Titan geothermal energy or rare wind crystals. Their primary goals are profit, the control of vital resources, and maintaining a network of neutral trade posts. Their methods include shrewd diplomacy, economic pressure, a well-funded intelligence network to anticipate resource shifts or political instability, and a small but elite fleet of armed escort vessels to protect their convoys. They are based in mobile 'Sky-Ports' – massive, interconnected platforms that drift in stable atmospheric layers or are anchored to the highest mountain peaks of relatively stable Titans.
