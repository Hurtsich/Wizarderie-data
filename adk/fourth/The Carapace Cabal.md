# The Carapace Cabal
**Description**: A powerful, insular guild that monopolizes the mining of rare minerals, solidified Titan ichor, and petrified biological matter from the shell and near-surface layers of 'Grandfather Shell.' Their society is rigidly hierarchical, with mining rights and influential positions passed down through bloodlines or brutal challenges. They are deeply territorial, viewing others as customers or threats, and maintain a well-equipped defensive force. They revere the Titan as a life-giving, finite resource they alone have the right to exploit, and are pragmatic and ruthless in their dealings, setting exorbitant prices for unique materials.
