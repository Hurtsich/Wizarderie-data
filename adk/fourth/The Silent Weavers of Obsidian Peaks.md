# The Silent Weavers of Obsidian Peaks
**Description**: A reclusive and technologically advanced society known as the 'Silent Weavers of Obsidian Peaks', residing on a single, ancient, and incredibly stable Titan characterized by vast, crystalline forests and deep, energy-rich obsidian veins. Their primary goal is the pursuit of knowledge, specifically understanding the deep history and life cycle of their host Titan and developing sustainable co-existence technologies. They are isolationist by nature, preferring to observe outsiders from afar and share their knowledge sparingly, if at all. Their methods involve intricate bio-engineering, crafting tools and structures from living crystal, and harnessing unique geothermal and exotic energy sources found only on their Titan. They possess advanced defensive capabilities, not for conquest, but for ensuring their solitude and protecting their unique environment. They interact with the outside world primarily through cryptic warnings or rare, highly valuable technological artifacts that occasionally find their way into other factions' hands.


## Identity
**Motto**: Harmony with the Titan, mastery of self.

**Reputation**: Mysterious, technologically superior, reclusive, enigmatic, wise.

There's a strange, unspoken understanding about protecting the Titans, despite differing methodologies.

**Strength**: Moderate

**Type**: Ideological/Wary Coexistence


### The Adamantine Hegemony
**Description**: The Hegemony is seen as a direct threat to the Weavers' existence and the well-being of their Titan. The Weavers employ advanced, non-lethal defensive measures and sophisticated camouflage to deter Hegemony probes and incursions, viewing them as destructive and primitive.

**Strength**: High

**Type**: Defensive/Antagonistic


### The Titan-Pathfinders' Guild
**Description**: The Weavers respect the Pathfinders' dedication to understanding Titan movements and occasionally share encrypted, anonymized data if it benefits wider Titan stability, seeing them as less directly destructive than other factions. However, they maintain strict boundaries regarding their own Titan.

**Strength**: Moderate

**Type**: Information/Limited Cooperation
