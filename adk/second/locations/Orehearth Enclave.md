# Orehearth Enclave
**Description**: A raw, bustling Dwarven mining settlement, freshly carved from the rock in the wake of a Great Worm's passage. Orehearth Enclave clings to the contours of a newly exposed, colossal worm tunnel, its heart centered around a breathtaking, recently breached geode cavern or a phenomenally rich mineral vein. The settlement is a chaotic yet purposeful blend of temporary wooden scaffolds, canvas tents, and rapidly constructed prefabricated stone huts, all overshadowed by the sounds of excavation and the beginnings of more permanent, deeply anchored Dwarven stonework. The air is thick with rock dust, the scent of newly broken earth, and the faint, warm musk of the Great Worm whose journey unveiled this bounty. It's a place of fervent activity, high hopes, and constant, wary vigilance.


## Geography
**Region**: The Outer Reaches of the Wurm-Scarred Deeps, along a newly charted Worm-Path.

**Landscape**: Primarily centered within a massive, freshly bored worm tunnel, one section of which has broken into a large geode cavern (the 'Gem-Gut Hollow') or exposed a major mineral lode (the 'Ironspine Vein'). The tunnel walls are smooth and cyclopean. The surrounding area consists of unstable rock, recently disturbed earth, and smaller offshoot tunnels. Temporary structures follow the tunnel's curves, gradually being replaced by stonework built into and reinforcing the passage.

**Climate**: Warm and humid due to geothermal proximity and recent worm activity. High mineral dust content in the air. The geode cavern maintains a slightly cooler, crystalline-scented atmosphere, while areas near active mining of a vein can be hotter from machinery and effort.

**Key Features**:
- The Great Worm's Passage (the main tunnel)

- The Gem-Gut Hollow / The Ironspine Vein (primary resource site)

- Adaptive Scaffolding Networks (temporary access and support)

- Emerging Stone Foundations (beginnings of permanent structures)

- Pioneer's Shafts (initial exploratory mining tunnels)

- The Worm-Rider's Landing (a designated stable area if the founding Worm is expected to return or be serviced)

**Points Of Interest**:
- Claim Master's Hovel (evolving into the 'Stonehall Command')

- The Ore-Crusher's Yard & Assay Tent

- The 'Dusty Pick' Tavern (a quickly assembled gathering spot)

- The Ancestor's Niche (a small, carved shrine to the Great Worms and forebears)

- The Crystal Heart (center of the geode) / The Vein's Core (richest part of the lode)

- The 'Deep Delve' main adit

- Makeshift Barracks and Mess Hall

**Threats**:
- Tunnel instability and rockfalls in newly exposed areas

- Hostile subterranean fauna (e.g., Gem-Claw Crabs, Tunnel Stalkers, Ore Borers) disturbed or attracted by the activity

- Rival prospecting teams or claim jumpers

- Sudden geothermal events (gas pockets, steam vents)

- Shortages of critical supplies before regular routes are established

- Health hazards from mineral dust or toxic gas releases


## Demographics
**Population**: Small but rapidly expanding: 300-600 Dwarves (miners, engineers, guards, support staff), with plans to grow as the claim proves viable.

**Typical Inhabitants**:
- Veteran Prospectors and Geologists

- Hard-Rock Miners and Demolition Experts

- Worm-Path Surveyors and Cartographers

- Emergency Masons and Structural Bracers

- Enclave Defenders (often doubling as laborers)

- Makeshift Cooks, Medics, and Supply Clerks

- A few junior Worm-Handlers if a smaller support worm is used for hauling


## Government
**Type**: Provisional Mining Charter Authority

**Ruling Power**: The Enclave Overseer (often the most experienced mining engineer or a tough, respected prospector), backed by a 'Foreman's Council' representing key operational groups (mining, defense, construction). Their authority is derived from a charter granted by a major clan or Deepburrow, focused on securing the claim and maximizing output.


## Economy
**Description**: Entirely focused on the immediate extraction and preliminary processing of minerals from the geode or vein. All resources are poured into expanding mining operations, improving defenses, and laying the groundwork for a permanent settlement. Initial trade is for survival and operational necessities.

**Main Exports**:
- Raw gemstones (if geode) / High-grade ore (if vein), shipped under heavy guard

- Core samples and geological reports to patrons/investors

- Urgent requests for specialized equipment and personnel

**Main Imports**:
- Heavy mining machinery and replacement parts

- Food, water, and medical supplies

- Lumber for shoring and temporary structures

- Fortification materials (pre-cut stone, metal reinforcements)

- Blasting powders and tools

- More Dwarves (laborers, specialists, guards)


## History
**Significance**: Orehearth Enclave is a raw, high-risk, high-reward venture, epitomizing the Dwarven drive to delve deep and uncover the earth's riches, facilitated by their Great Worm partners. Its success would carve a new, prosperous artery into the Wurm-Scarred Deeps, while failure could mean a costly loss of life and resources. It's a story of Dwarven grit and symbiotic opportunism in real-time.

**Notable Events**:
- The 'Deep-Render's' Passage: The recent earth-shattering journey of a named Great Worm that fortuitously exposed the rich deposit.

- The Glimmering Discovery: The first scouting party, following the Worm's trail, stumbles upon the breathtaking geode or the rich vein.

- Founding the Claim: The arrival of the first wave of chartered miners and guards, who hastily erect the initial camp.

- The 'First Pick' Ceremony: A ritualistic first strike of the pickaxe into the main deposit, marking the official start of operations.

- Repelling the 'Tunnel Terrors': The first significant encounter with hostile native creatures, testing the Enclave's defenses.

- Laying the 'Hearthstone Foundation': The ceremonial placement of the first large, dressed stone for the future Enclave Hall, signifying commitment to a permanent settlement.
