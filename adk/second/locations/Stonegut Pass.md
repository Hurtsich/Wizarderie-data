# Stonegut Pass
**Description**: Stonegut Pass is a formidable Dwarven fortified town, ingeniously constructed within the colossal, smooth-bored tunnel left by an ancient, now dormant Great Worm. This tunnel serves as the sole critical passage through the otherwise impassable Dragon's Tooth Mountains, making Stonegut a strategic linchpin for trade and military movement. Its defenses are carved directly into the tunnel's stone walls, featuring layered fortifications, massive toll gates, and ingenious acoustic traps that exploit the tunnel's unique, echoing properties. The air within is cool, carries the scent of old stone and metal, and every sound reverberates, creating an environment where whispers can travel like shouts and a warhorn's call can deafen.


## Geography
**Region**: The Dragon's Tooth Mountains, marking a border of the Wurm-Scarred Deeps.

**Landscape**: A single, massive, ancient worm tunnel, several hundred feet in diameter, running for miles through the heart of a jagged mountain range. The tunnel interior is mostly smooth, with sections heavily carved and fortified. Entrances on either side of the mountain range are heavily guarded and often battered by severe alpine weather. Side caverns and niches, some natural, some excavated, serve as barracks, storage, and living quarters.

**Climate**: Alpine at the tunnel entrances, with cold winds, heavy snow in winter, and risk of avalanches. Inside the tunnel, the temperature is consistently cool and stable, with strong drafts channelled by Dwarven engineering and the tunnel's natural shape. Humidity is moderate. The acoustics create an environment where sound carries exceptionally far and can be amplified or distorted.

**Key Features**:
- The Great Dormant Worm Tunnel

- The Adamantine Great Gates (massive toll and defense gates at primary choke points)

- Echoing Bastions (fortifications designed to amplify defensive sounds and disorient attackers)

- Carved Ramparts and Arrow Slits (integrated into the tunnel walls)

- The Silent Sentinels (statues or golems that also serve as acoustic resonators)

- The Deep Resonator (a central chamber designed to focus sound for communication or defense)

- Toll Caverns (large chambers for processing caravans and collecting fees)

**Points Of Interest**:
- The Ironjaw Gate (eastern entrance)

- The Stonegut Gate (western entrance)

- The Roaring Hall (main customs and toll collection chamber, known for its overwhelming acoustics)

- The Warden's Spire (command tower carved into a central tunnel pillar)

- The Armory of Echoes (where sound-based weaponry and defensive tools are stored and maintained)

- The Quiet Barracks (specially insulated living quarters for off-duty guards)

- The Whisperwind Market (a small, secure trading post within the pass)

**Threats**:
- Military assault aimed at capturing the pass

- Smuggling attempts to bypass tolls and inspections

- Bandit raids on caravans within or near the pass

- Natural hazards at tunnel mouths (rockslides, avalanches)

- Misuse or accidental triggering of acoustic defenses

- Structural fatigue in ancient, unreinforced sections of the tunnel (rare, but monitored)

- Internal dissent or sabotage from within the diverse population of the pass


## Demographics
**Population**: Approximately 1,500-2,500 Dwarves (military personnel, engineers, toll collectors, merchants, support staff), with a transient population of traders from various races.

**Typical Inhabitants**:
- Stonegut Guard (heavily armored Dwarven soldiers trained for tunnel fighting)

- Tunnel Engineers and Masons (maintaining fortifications and tunnel integrity)

- Toll Masters and Scribes (managing passage fees and records)

- Siege Artificers (specializing in acoustic weaponry and gate mechanics)

- Echo Wardens (Dwarves with keen hearing, trained to interpret sounds within the pass and operate acoustic defenses)

- Supply merchants and provisioners

- Visiting caravan guards and traders of various races (Humans, other Dwarven clans)


## Government
**Type**: Fortified Military Governorship under charter from Deepburrow.

**Ruling Power**: The Pass-Commander, a veteran Dwarven officer appointed by the Deep Council of Deepburrow or a major sponsoring clan. The Pass-Commander holds authority over all military and civil matters within Stonegut Pass, primarily focused on defense, toll collection, and maintaining order.


## Economy
**Description**: The economy of Stonegut Pass revolves almost entirely around the collection of tolls from passing caravans and individuals. Secondary income comes from providing secure lodging, resupply services, and basic repairs. Minor mining operations occasionally exploit small mineral deposits exposed by the ancient worm, but this is secondary to its strategic role.

**Main Exports**:
- Secure passage through the Dragon's Tooth Mountains

- Logistical support and resupply for travellers

- Information regarding mountain conditions and potential threats

- Rarely, small quantities of unique minerals found within the tunnel walls

**Main Imports**:
- Foodstuffs and drink for the garrison and inhabitants

- Raw materials for maintaining fortifications (metal, stone, specialized components)

- Weapons and armor reinforcements

- Goods carried by merchant caravans (which are taxed)

- Fuel for forges and heating (especially important at the colder tunnel mouths)


## History
**Significance**: Stonegut Pass is a monument to both the raw power of a Great Worm in a bygone era and the enduring ingenuity of the Dwarves in adapting such a colossal feature for their strategic benefit. Its control has dictated the flow of trade and armies for centuries, making it a site of numerous historic sieges and legendary feats of defense. The unique acoustics have also given rise to many local legends and specialized martial traditions.

**Notable Events**:
- The Passage of Stonegut the Ancient: The legendary Great Worm whose passage created the tunnel, an event lost to deep history but commemorated in the pass's name.

- The Discovery of the Dormant Way: When Dwarven explorers first realized the ancient tunnel provided a viable route through the mountains.

- The Great Fortification: A decades-long project to carve defenses and establish the town within the pass.

- The Siege of a Thousand Screams: A famous historical battle where the pass's acoustic defenses played a pivotal role in repelling a massive invasion force.

- The Tollmasters' Compact: An agreement standardizing toll rates and passage rights, reducing inter-clan friction.

- The Whispering Treason: An infamous incident where spies used the tunnel's acoustics to pass sensitive information, leading to enhanced sonic security measures.
