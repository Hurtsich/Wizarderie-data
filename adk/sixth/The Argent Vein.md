{'name': 'Aerie Nexus', 'description': "A bustling, multi-tiered sky-city carved directly into the upper carapace of the Grand Elder Titan, Terra-Mundi. Aerie Nexus serves as the undisputed nexus of inter-Titan airship travel and trade, a place where the winds are as constant as the flow of commerce and intrigue. Its towering spires, meticulously shaped from the Titan's calcified bone and shell, pierce the clouds, while lower levels buzz with the activity of docking bays, sprawling markets, and raucous taverns. The constant, powerful winds necessitate not only robust architectural design but also exceptionally skilled airship pilots and navigators. The air is a heady mix of ozone, exotic spices carried from distant Titans, and the rich tang of engine exhaust, creating an atmosphere of vibrant, often chaotic, life. Below its elevated plateaus, the swirling cloud currents hide both the promise of new discoveries and the threat of unseen dangers. This is a melting pot of cultures, a gateway to the skies, and a place where fortunes are made and lost with every passing airship.", 'geography': {'region': 'Upper Carapace of Terra-Mundi (Grand Elder Titan)', 'landscape': "Elevated, wind-swept plateau with deep canyons and fissures leading down into the Titan's body.
