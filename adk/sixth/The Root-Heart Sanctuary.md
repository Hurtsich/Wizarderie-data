    "title": "Forging Your Legend: A Guide to Character Creation in Aethelgard",
    "introduction": "Welcome to Aethelgard, a world borne upon the colossal backs of living Titans! Here, civilizations cling to shifting landscapes, sky-ships chart courses through cloud-filled skies, and destiny is as unpredictable as the tremor of a waking giant. This guide will help you create a unique character ready to face the wonders and perils of this dynamic world using the FATE Core system. Character creation in FATE is a collaborative process, focused on crafting a compelling individual with drives, flaws, and a distinct place in the world. Let's begin!",
    "creating_your_aspects": {
      "general_advice": "Aspects are short, descriptive phrases that define who your character is, what they're good at, what problems they face, and what's important to them. Good aspects are double-edged swords: they can be invoked (used to your benefit by spending a Fate Point) or compelled (used by the GM to introduce complications, earning you a Fate Point). They should be evocative, tie into the world of Aethelgard, and hint at potential stories. Don't be afraid to make them specific!",
      "high_concept": {
        "explanation": "Your High Concept is a broad, punchy phrase summarizing your character's core identity. It's who you are at a glance, often combining your primary role or archetype with a distinctive Aethelgardian flair. Think of it as your character's tagline.",
        "advice": "Make it vivid! Are you a 'Dashing Sky-Corsair of the Azure Clouds,' a 'Hard-Bitten Shifting Maw Prospector,' or perhaps a 'Warden Initiate Listening to Aethelgard's Silent Heart'? Your High Concept should immediately suggest what your character does and how they fit into the unique setting of Titans and sky-ships. Combine your profession with an origin, a notable skill, or a defining characteristic. Examples from the RuleSet include: 'Titan-Maw Scavenger,' 'Warden Scholar of Aethelgard's Roots.'"
      },
      "trouble": {
        "explanation": "Your Trouble is a personal complication, an external problem, or a flaw that consistently makes your character's life more interesting (and often more difficult). This is a primary source of compels and Fate Points, driving your character into challenging situations.",
        "advice": "Choose a Trouble that will actively create story opportunities. Is it an unpaid debt to the Aerie Syndicate ('Hunted by Syndicate Enforcers')? A dangerous personal trait ('Uncontrollable Titan-Sense That Screams at Danger')? Or perhaps a difficult past ('The Only Survivor of the Sky-Serpent's Attack')? A good Trouble is something you can't easily solve but must constantly navigate. It could be a recurring enemy, a crippling fear related to the Titans or the Below-Lands, or a problematic personality quirk. Consider troubles like: 'Crippling Fear of the Below-Lands,' 'My Airship is a Flying Pile of Debt and Hope,' or 'Sworn to Protect a Secret of the Silent Wardens.'"
      },
      "other_aspects_phase_guide": {
        "introduction": "Beyond your High Concept and Trouble, you'll choose three more aspects. The Aethelgard rules suggest focusing these around your connection to the Titans, your role in its sky-faring society, and a key relationship or ambition. These aspects help ground your character firmly in the world.",
        "titan_connection": {
          "prompt": "Your first additional aspect should reflect your character's origin or a significant past experience related to a specific Titan or the general nature of living on them.",
          "advice": "How has life on a moving, breathing giant shaped you? Were you 'Born on the Shifting Back of Gorok,' making you nimble and wary? Do you carry 'Whispers of the Storm-Caller in My Blood,' giving you an affinity for wild weather? Perhaps 'Terra-Mundi's Rhythms Soothe My Soul.' This aspect can explain unique knowledge, fears, or even physical traits. Consider the specific Titan: someone from the humid Azure Leviathan will be different from a native of the mineral-rich Argent Vein."
        },
        "skyfaring_allegiance_or_role": {
          "prompt": "Next, create an aspect describing your character's profession, loyalties, or primary function within Aethelgard's sky-faring society.",
          "advice": "What's your day-to-day life like amidst the clouds and Titan-peaks? Are you a 'Resourceful Independent Sky-Trader, Always Seeking the Next Deal'? An 'Ace Pilot for the Aerie Syndicate, Loyal to the Core'? Or maybe a 'Guardian of the Ancient Titan Glyphs,' dedicated to preserving forgotten lore? This aspect can tie you to factions like the Aerie Syndicate or the Silent Wardens, or establish your independence. Think about your skills and how you use them: 'Master Sky-Ship Engineer,' 'Maw-Walker Guide Through Chaos,' 'Negotiator for the Aerie Nexus Council.'"
        },
        "defining_relationship_or_ambition": {
          "prompt": "Finally, an aspect about a significant connection to another character (PC or NPC), a faction, or a driving personal goal in Aethelgard.",
          "advice": "What truly motivates your character? Is it 'My Loyalty to Captain Elara is Unshakeable'? A burning desire to 'Discover the Secret of the Sky-Fall Prophecy'? Or perhaps a vendetta, 'I Will Avenge My Crew Against the Crimson Sky-Pirates'? This aspect adds personal depth and provides strong hooks for the GM. It could also be a commitment, like 'Dedicated to Freeing My Sibling from Syndicate Indenture' or 'Seeking the Lost Archives of the First Wardens.'"
        }
      }
    },
    "selecting_your_skills": {
      "overview": "Skills represent your character's broad capabilities. In Aethelgard, while many FATE skills find new life (Athletics for climbing Titan carapaces, Crafts for sky-ship repair), pay special attention to 'Pilot (Sky-Ship)' for navigating the aerial highways, and the unique 'Titan Ken' skill, crucial for understanding and surviving the living worlds beneath your feet. Refer to the full skill list in the Aethelgard RuleSet for descriptions.",
      "skill_distribution": "You'll arrange your skills in a pyramid: one skill at Great (+4), two at Good (+3), three at Fair (+2), and four at Average (+1). All other skills are considered Mediocre (+0), meaning you roll them with no bonus.",
      "advice_on_selection": "Choose skills that reflect your High Concept and other aspects. A 'Dashing Sky-Corsair' will likely have high Pilot (Sky-Ship) and perhaps Fight or Shoot. A 'Warden Scholar' might prioritize Lore and Titan Ken. \n\n*   **Synergy:** Think about how your aspects and skills work together. An aspect like 'Aerie Nexus Native' could justify a good Contacts or Investigate skill for navigating the city's underbelly.\n*   **Role:** Consider your intended role. Are you the ship's pilot, the keen-eyed scout, the negotiator, the brawler, or the Titan expert?\n*   **Titan Ken:** This skill is uniquely Aethelgardian. It helps you understand Titan behavior, navigate their hazardous terrains, and identify unique flora/fauna. It can be invaluable for explorers, survivalists, scholars, or anyone living close to the Titans.\n*   **Flavor:** Remember that even standard skills get an Aethelgard twist. Deceive might be used to bluff Syndicate patrols, Empathy to sense a Titan's 'mood,' and Physique to endure the violent lurches of the Quake-Beast."

    "choosing_and_creating_stunts": {
      "role_of_stunts": "Stunts are special abilities that let your character bend or break the rules in specific, exciting ways. They make your character uniquely awesome at something, often by enhancing a skill or leveraging an aspect in a new mechanical fashion. Each character typically starts with three stunts, and each stunt chosen reduces your starting Refresh (Fate Point pool) by one.",
      "choosing_stunts": "Select stunts that complement your highest-rated skills and your character concept. The Aethelgard RuleSet provides excellent examples like 'Daring Sky-Maneuver (Pilot)' or 'Titan-Sense Empathy (Titan Ken).' Does your 'Syndicate Insider' aspect manifest as a stunt that gives you bonuses on Contacts rolls within their territory? Does your 'Master Scavenger' find better loot?",
      "creating_your_own_stunts": {
        "introduction": "FATE encourages creating your own stunts! If the examples don't quite fit, or you have a cool idea, work with your GM to craft something unique. The best Aethelgard stunts will feel deeply tied to the setting.",
        "guidelines": [
          "Give a +2 bonus to a skill in a very specific circumstance (e.g., '+2 to Fight when on unsteady Titan ground').",
          "Allow a skill to be used for an action it normally couldn't (e.g., 'Use Titan Ken instead of Investigate to track creatures native to a specific Titan').",
          "Once per session, allow a minor success (tie) on a specific roll to become a full success, or a success to become a success with style.",
          "Grant an extra free invocation when you Create an Advantage using a particular skill in a defined way (e.g., 'When you use Crafts to jury-rig a sky-ship component, gain an extra free invoke on the aspect created').",
          "For a Fate Point, allow a powerful, once-per-session effect (e.g., 'Spend a Fate Point to ignore all penalties from a Titan-Storm for one Pilot roll')."
        ],
        "collaboration": "Always discuss custom stunts with your GM. They can help ensure the stunt is balanced, fits FATE's design, and enriches the game for everyone. Think about the unique challenges of Aethelgard: stunts related to navigating specific Titan environments (like the Shifting Maw or the Storm-Caller's vortex), interacting with Titan-Touched Beasts, or leveraging unique faction resources."

        "example_stunt": "**Whispers of the Deep Stone (Titan Ken):** When on or within a Titan known for its ancient wisdom (like Aethelgard or Terra-Mundi), you can spend a Fate Point to ask the GM one question about the Titan's immediate emotional state, recent significant disturbances, or a hidden short-term danger, and receive a truthful, if perhaps cryptic, answer."
      }
    ],
    "final_steps": {
      "refresh": "Your starting Refresh is typically 3. Each stunt you choose reduces your Refresh by one. Your Fate Points reset to your Refresh score at the beginning of each game session.",
      "stress_and_consequences": "Note your Physical and Mental stress tracks (usually starting with 2 boxes each) and familiarize yourself with how consequences work (Mild, Moderate, Severe) to absorb damage or negative effects. Think about what kind of consequences your Aethelgard character might face – from 'Wind-Chapped and Weary' to 'Ship Impounded by Aerie Nexus Port Authority'!",
      "sky_ships_and_gear": "While not part of initial character creation numbers, start thinking about your character's essential gear for survival in Aethelgard and, if applicable, their connection to a sky-ship. These details will emerge as you begin your adventures!"
