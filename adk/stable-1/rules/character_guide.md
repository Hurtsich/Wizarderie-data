**Character Creation Guide Title**: Saga of the Sky Titans: Character Creation Guide


## Introduction
**Title**: Welcome to Erden, World of Wandering Titans!

**Text**: Welcome, brave adventurer, to the world of Erden, a realm defined by the colossal, continent-sized Titans that roam its face. You are about to embark on a journey where survival, discovery, and destiny are intrinsically linked to these majestic, and often terrifying, living landscapes. This guide will walk you through creating a character who is not only competent and capable but also deeply woven into the fabric of this dynamic world. In Saga of the Sky Titans, we use the Fate Core system, focusing on collaborative storytelling. Your character's Aspects, Skills, and unique Stunts will shape how you interact with Erden, its diverse cultures, its mysterious Aetheric energies, and the very Titans themselves. Let's forge a hero ready to leave their mark on a world in constant motion!


## Aspects Guide
**Title**: Defining Your Hero: Aspects

**Explanation**: Aspects are short, descriptive phrases that define who your character is, what they believe, what connections they have, or significant things about them. They are the narrative heart of your character, providing reasons to award you Fate Points (when they complicate your life – a 'compel') and opportunities to spend Fate Points (to gain bonuses or re-rolls – an 'invoke'). A good aspect is double-edged: it can help you and hinder you, making for more interesting stories. Your character will have five aspects in total: a High Concept, a Trouble, and three other aspects often developed through the 'Phase Trio' of character creation.


### High Concept
**Title**: High Concept: Your Core Identity

**Description**: This is a broad phrase that sums up the essentials of your character – their primary role, calling, or archetype within the world of Erden. It should immediately tell us something significant about what your character does and who they are. Think about your character's place in a world of Titans, Aetheric energies, and distinct factions.

**Advice**: Consider your character's origin (on Aerios the Sky-Lord, Geode the Stone Walker, Thalassa the Ocean Wanderer, or the Underworld), their primary profession, or their connection to unique Erden phenomena like Resonance Weaving.

**Examples**:
- Sky-Shepherd Wind-Talker from Aerios

- Hard-Bitten Shard-Miner Demolitions Expert

- Aether-Sensitive Resonance Weaver of Thalassa's Depths

- Relic Hunter of Fallen Titanfall Zones

- Underworld Emissary to the Titan Dwellers

- Grizzled Sky-Skiff Smuggler


### Trouble
**Title**: Trouble: Your Personal Complication

**Description**: This aspect represents a significant recurring problem, flaw, debt, or vulnerability that makes your character's life more difficult, but also more interesting. Your Trouble is a reliable source of compels and Fate Points.

**Advice**: Link your Trouble to the dangers of Erden, personal failings, enemies, or difficult relationships. It should be something that can't be easily solved and frequently rears its head.

**Examples**:
- Crippling Fear of Titan-Quakes

- Marked for Death by the Shard-Miners Union

- My Aetheric Weaving is Unpredictably Destructive

- Loyal to a Corrupt Titan Cult

- Haunted by the Ghost of a Lost Titan

- A Bounty on My Head in Three Sky-Ports


### Other Aspects Phase Trio
**Title**: Other Aspects: Building Your Story (Phase Trio)

**Description**: You'll create three more aspects. Often, these are developed through a process called the Phase Trio (or similar story-building steps with your group). These aspects flesh out your character's backstory, significant events, relationships (often with other player characters), beliefs, or unique possessions tied to Erden.

**Phase One Adventure**: Your first additional aspect often comes from a significant past adventure or event that shaped you. What quest, discovery, or crisis defined an early chapter of your life on or around the Titans?

**Phase One Examples**:
- I Charted the Unstable Spine of Aerios

- Sole Survivor of the Whispering Chasm Expedition

- My Family's Sky-Skiff, 'The Wanderer'

- I Can Hear the Song of Geode's Heart

**Phase Two Three Crossing Paths**: The next two aspects often emerge from how your path crossed with another player character's story, creating shared history, debts, rivalries, or alliances. These tie the group together.

**Phase Two Three Examples**:
- Bound by a Blood Oath on the Foundry Floe

- Saved [Another PC's Name] from a Sky-Kraken

- I Don't Trust [Another PC's Name] Further Than I Can Throw a Grapple-Hook

- We Stole the Titan-Core Shard Together

**Advice Good Aspects**: Good aspects are specific enough to be interesting but open enough for varied interpretation. They should suggest ways you can be awesome and ways things can go wrong. Think about what makes life on Erden unique: the constant movement, the factions, the strange ecologies, the Aetheric energies. If you're stuck, describe an idea in a sentence, and the group can help you find a punchy phrase. Remember, you can always refine aspects later!


## Skills Guide
**Title**: Abilities and Aptitudes: Skills

**Explanation**: Skills represent your character's training, natural talents, and areas of expertise. In Fate, skills are rated on a ladder (e.g., Average +1, Fair +2, Good +3, Great +4). You'll typically arrange your skills in a pyramid: one skill at Great (+4), two at Good (+3), three at Fair (+2), and four at Average (+1). All other skills are Mediocre (+0).

**Skill List Title**: Skills in the Saga of the Sky Titans

**Description**: While many standard Fate skills are applicable, Erden also demands specialized knowledge and abilities. Discuss with your GM the exact skill list, but expect to see:


### Weaving
**Details**: Crucial for Resonance Weaving – manipulating Aetheric energies from Titans and the environment. Used to Overcome magical obstacles, Create Advantages like 'Symbiotic Vigor', Attack with 'Aetheric Javelins', or Defend with 'Kinetic Barriers'.


### Titan Lore
**Details**: Knowledge of Titan biology, behavior, Aetheric patterns, hazards, unique flora/fauna, and history. Essential for predicting Titan movements, identifying resources, or understanding ancient Titan-related mysteries.


### Survival
**Details**: Thriving in the diverse and often hostile biomes on Titan-backs or in the Underworld. Covers foraging, shelter, tracking, and enduring environmental hazards specific to Aerios's peaks, Geode's depths, or Thalassa's oceans.


### Scavenge
**Details**: Finding useful resources, salvaging parts from old tech or Titan remains, and identifying valuable materials. Key for resource management and crafting.


### Pilot
**Details**: Operating sky-skiffs, airships, potentially specialized land vehicles, or even guiding large domesticated creatures used for transport across or between Titans.


### Sky-Navigation
**Details**: Plotting courses through the often-turbulent skies between Titans or across their vast surfaces, understanding Aetheric currents and weather patterns.


### Athletics
**Details**: Physical prowess for climbing treacherous Titan surfaces, leaping chasms, swimming strong currents, and navigating dangerous terrain during Titan tremors.


### Craft
**Details**: Creating, repairing, or modifying equipment, often using unique Titan-derived materials like chitin, crystals, or bio-luminescent flora. Also for processing raw resources.


### Physique
**Details**: Your physical toughness and strength. Higher Physique grants more Physical Stress boxes and even an extra mild consequence slot at Superb+.


### Will
**Details**: Your mental fortitude, discipline, and self-control. Higher Will grants more Mental Stress boxes and an extra mild consequence slot at Superb+.


### Notice
**Details**: Perception and awareness, spotting subtle clues, impending dangers, or shifts in the Titan's behavior.


### Investigate
**Details**: Deducing information, solving mysteries, deciphering ancient glyphs, or researching Titan phenomena.

### Diplomacy
**Details**: Negotiating, persuading, and making connections with different cultures and factions, from Sky-Shepherd elders to Shard-Miner foremen.


### Empathy
**Details**: Understanding others' emotions and motives; can be crucial for delicate social interactions or even sensing the 'mood' of less hostile Titan-fauna.


### Intimidate
**Details**: Using threats and presence to get what you want.


### Resources
**Details**: Your access to wealth, equipment, and contacts for acquiring goods and services.


### Fight
**Details**: Skill in close-quarters combat, whether with fists, claws, or traditional melee weapons.


### Shoot
**Details**: Proficiency with ranged weapons, from humble bows to Aether-powered rifles or skiff-mounted weaponry.

**Customization Note**: Your GM may have a slightly different skill list or allow for custom skills that fit your character concept and the campaign's focus. Always discuss your ideas!


## Stunts Guide
**Title**: Unique Talents: Stunts

**Explanation**: Stunts are special abilities that let your character bend or break the rules in specific, limited ways, often by enhancing a skill or providing a unique capability. They make your character distinct and reflect their particular knacks or training. You typically start with three free stunts. Taking more stunts (up to five total) will reduce your starting Refresh (Fate Points per session).

**Role Of Stunts**: Stunts allow you to reliably do something cool, gain a specific mechanical benefit in certain situations, or use a skill in a way others can't. They should be tied to your character's aspects, highest skills, and their role in the world of Erden.

**Creating Stunts**: Good stunts usually grant a +2 bonus to a specific action with a skill under particular circumstances, allow a skill to be used in place of another for a narrow purpose, or give a character a unique small rule exception. Work with your GM to create stunts that are balanced and flavorful.

**Stunt Examples Title**: Example Stunts in Erden:


### Resonant Attunement (Weaving)
**Description**: Once per session, when you Create an Advantage with Weaving related to sensing or understanding Aetheric energies, gain an additional free invocation on that aspect if you succeed.


### Aetheric Lash (Weaving)
**Description**: When you succeed with style on an Attack action using Weaving, you can choose to inflict a relevant Mild Consequence instead of gaining a boost.


### Titan-Whisperer (Titan Lore)
**Description**: You gain a +2 to Titan Lore rolls made to predict the immediate localized behavior of a Titan you are familiar with (e.g., the one you primarily live on).


### Chitin-Reinforced Gear (Craft)
**Description**: Because you expertly reinforce your gear with Titan chitin, you gain an additional Physical stress box (value 1). This does not stack with other armor if armor provides stress boxes.


### Sky-Shepherd's Grace (Pilot/Athletics)
**Description**: When on your native Titan (e.g., Aerios), you gain +2 to Pilot or Athletics rolls to overcome hazards caused by sudden Titan movements or extreme weather.


### Union Network Access (Investigate/Resources)
**Description**: Once per game session, you can use your Shard-Miner Union contacts to find a piece of restricted information or acquire a rare (but not unique) piece of Union technology by making an Investigate or Resources roll against Fair (+2) difficulty.


## Refresh Guide
**Title**: Starting Refresh

**Explanation**: Refresh determines how many Fate Points you start each game session with. The default starting Refresh is 3. For each stunt you take beyond your initial three free ones, your Refresh is reduced by one. So, if you take:

**Rates**:
- 3 Stunts = Refresh of 3

- 4 Stunts = Refresh of 2

- 5 Stunts = Refresh of 1

**Note**: A lower Refresh means fewer Fate Points at the start, but more cool abilities via stunts. It's a trade-off to consider based on your playstyle.


## World Connection Guide
**Title**: Rooting Your Character in Erden

**Text**: To make your character truly come alive, consider their connections to the unique world of Saga of the Sky Titans:


### Points
**Title**: Origin Story

**Description**: Where do you hail from? The icy peaks of Aerios, the volcanic depths of Geode, the island chains on Thalassa's shell, or the more conventional Basin Lands of the Underworld? Perhaps a specific settlement like the Aerie of the Whispering Peaks or the industrial hub of The Deep Vein? How has this origin shaped your skills, beliefs, and aspects?


### Points
**Title**: Faction Affiliation

**Description**: Are you a nomadic Sky-Shepherd, revering the Titans? A pragmatic Shard-Miner, exploiting their resources? Or do you belong to another Titan-dwelling culture, an Underworld kingdom, or perhaps you're fiercely independent? Your loyalties (or lack thereof) will define many of your interactions and conflicts.


### Points
**Title**: Relationship with Titans

**Description**: Do you see Titans as sacred beings, dangerous beasts, valuable resources, or objects of scientific curiosity? Does your character have a particular affinity or fear related to them? This relationship should influence your aspects and motivations.


### Points
**Title**: Resonance Weaving

**Description**: If your character is a Resonance Weaver, how did they discover this ability? Who taught them, or was it an innate talent? What are their specialties, and how does this power manifest? Their aspects, skills (especially Weaving), and stunts should reflect this Aetheric connection.


### Points
**Title**: Surviving the Unpredictable

**Description**: Life on Erden is perilous. How has your character adapted to the constant threat of Titan movements, environmental hazards, and resource scarcity? What skills, aspects, or stunts represent their resilience and ingenuity?
