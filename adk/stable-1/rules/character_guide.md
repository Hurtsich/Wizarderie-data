**Character Creation Guide Title**: Saga of the Wandering Titans: Your Character Creation Journey


## Introduction
**Title**: Welcome to Titan's Rest!

**Text**: Prepare to forge your legend in Titan's Rest, a world unlike any other! Here, colossal, ancient Titans roam, their very bodies serving as the foundation for civilizations, diverse biomes, and untold wonders. From the sky-lanes plied by daring Zephyr Cartel sky-ships to the treacherous surfaces scaled by intrepid explorers, life is a constant adventure. You are about to create a unique hero, someone who will navigate these mobile lands, uncover forgotten secrets, and perhaps even shape the destiny of the Titans themselves. FATE is a game of collaborative storytelling, and crafting your character is the thrilling first step in weaving your epic tale together with your fellow players and the Game Master (GM). Let's begin!


## Character Concept
**Title**: The Core Idea: Your Character Concept

**Text**: Before diving into the mechanics, take a moment to imagine your hero. Who are they in this world of living lands and sky-high adventure? Are they a seasoned veteran of inter-Titan trade, a mystic tied to the very pulse of a Titan, or a survivor hardened by the perils of this unique existence? Don't be afraid to think big and bold!

**Archetype Examples Intro**: Here are a few sparks to ignite your imagination, drawing from the diverse peoples and challenges of Titan's Rest:

**Archetype Examples**:
- Daring Zephyr Cartel Sky-Ship Pilot, charting new routes through hazardous sky-currents.

- Mysterious Earthkin Tremor-Speaker, interpreting the whispers of Grandfather Shell.

- Resourceful Geocrag Miner, unearthing rare crystals from the petrified Titan's depths.

- Veteran Titan-Climber, seeking forgotten lore atop colossal beasts.

- Reformed Sky-Pirate with a Hidden Heart, now flying for a nobler cause.

- Explorer of Ancient Titan Ruins, piecing together the mysteries of a bygone age.

- Determined Cryos Ice-Fisher, braving the frozen wastes for survival and discovery.

**Encouragement**: Think about what excites you most about this world, and let that guide your initial concept. Your character will grow and change through play, but a strong starting idea will make your journey even more engaging.


## Aspects Guide
**Title**: Step 1: Aspects - Defining Who You Are

**Explanation**: In FATE, Aspects are short, descriptive phrases that highlight what's most important, interesting, or dramatic about your character. They are *always true* about your character. You can 'invoke' Aspects by spending a Fate Point for a +2 bonus on a roll or a re-roll when the Aspect is relevant. The GM (or even you!) can 'compel' an Aspect to introduce a complication into the story related to that Aspect; when this happens, you gain a Fate Point. Good Aspects are double-edged – they can help you, but also create interesting trouble!

**Aspect Types Intro**: Your character will have five Aspects, each helping to paint a picture of who they are:


### High Concept
**Description**: This is a broad summary of your character, their core identity and role. Think of it as your character's 'job title' or defining characteristic in the world of Titan's Rest.

**Examples Intro**: Examples:

**Examples**:
- Sky-Weathered Zephyr Cartel Cartographer

- Last Survivor of the Arboria Root-Plague

- Geocrag Prospector with a Titan-Shard Compass

- Disgraced Sky-Guard Seeking Redemption

- Earthkin Bio-Alchemist with a Symbiotic Companion


### Trouble
**Description**: Everyone has a weakness, a recurring problem, or a dark secret. This Aspect represents something that makes your character's life complicated. It's a great source of drama and Fate Points!

**Examples Intro**: Examples:

**Examples**:
- Crippling Vertigo on Titan Edges

- Hunted by the Cloudreaver Sky-Pirates

- Owes a Life Debt to an Earthkin Elder

- Addicted to Rare Titan-Nectar

- My Sky-Ship is a Jealous Mistress


### Titan-Forged Past (Phase 1)
**Description**: Describe a significant early adventure, a defining moment from your character's past that was shaped by life on or between the Titans. This event helped make them who they are today.

**Examples Intro**: Examples:

**Examples**:
- Survived a Geocrag Rockslide by Sheer Luck

- Witnessed the Majesty of a Migrating Sky-Whale

- Escaped a Sky-Pirate Ambush in the Titan's Shadow

- Found an Ancient Relic in a Titan's Gut

- My Village Was Devoured by a Shifting Fissure


### Crossed Paths (Phase 2)
**Description**: This Aspect connects your character to another Player Character (PC). Work with another player to come up with a shared experience or relationship forged amidst the challenges of the Titan world. This builds immediate group cohesion.

**Examples Intro**: Examples (discuss with another player!):

**Examples**:
- Rescued [Fellow PC] from a Collapsing Ice Cave on Cryos

- Competed Against [Fellow PC] in the Aetherium Sky-Race

- Shared a Tent with [Fellow PC] During a Grandfather Shell Tremor-Storm

- We Were Once Rival Scavengers on a Fallen Titan

- [Fellow PC] Knows My Darkest Secret


### Skybound Ambition (Phase 3)
**Description**: What is your character currently striving for? This Aspect reflects a current goal, a driving ambition, or a significant recent event that shapes their present actions and propels them into the story.

**Examples Intro**: Examples:

**Examples**:
- Seeking the Legendary Sunken City of Leviathus

- To Prove the Innocence of my Disgraced Zephyr Cartel Mentor

- Must Find a Cure for the Spreading Chitin-Rot

- I Will Chart a Safe Passage Through the Titan Graveyard

- Driven to Understand the Titans' True Purpose

**Usage Reminder**: Remember, Aspects are your storytelling tools! Use them to your advantage and embrace the complications they bring for a richer game experience.


## Skills Guide
**Title**: Step 2: Skills - What You Can Do

**Explanation**: Skills represent your character's training, talents, and areas of expertise. In Saga of the Wandering Titans, you'll distribute your skill ratings in a pyramid: one skill at Great (+4), two skills at Good (+3), three skills at Fair (+2), and four skills at Average (+1). Any skill not on your list is considered Mediocre (+0), meaning you're not particularly good or bad at it, but you can still try!

**Skill List Reference**: Refer to the 'Skills_Titanborne' section in the campaign ruleset for the full list of available skills and their descriptions. These skills are specifically tailored for life in Titan's Rest.

**Advice On Selection**: Choose skills that fit your character concept and Aspects. What would a 'Sky-Weathered Zephyr Cartel Cartographer' be good at? Probably Drive/Pilot, Academics (for cartography), and Notice. What about a 'Mysterious Earthkin Tremor-Speaker'? Empathy, Survival (Titan), and Resolve seem like strong choices.

**Highlighted Skills Intro**: Consider these key skills for life among the Titans:


### Survival (Titan)
**Description**: Essential for anyone venturing onto a Titan's surface, dealing with its unique ecosystems, finding sustenance, or navigating its treacherous landscapes.


### Drive/Pilot
**Description**: Crucial for sky-ship captains, land vehicle operators, or anyone needing to maneuver specialized transports through the challenging environments of Titan's Rest.


### Resolve
**Description**: This skill helps your character withstand the mind-bending scale of the Titans, the unsettling energies they emit, and the psychological toll of living in such an awe-inspiring yet perilous world. It's key to managing your Titan Strain stress track.


### Crafts
**Description**: From repairing sky-ship engines with salvaged parts to fashioning survival gear from Titan chitin, this skill is invaluable for tinkerers and creators.

**Final Advice**: Don't worry about covering every possibility; your character is part of a team, and others will have different strengths.


## Stunts Guide
**Title**: Step 3: Stunts - Your Unique Talents

**Explanation**: Stunts are special abilities that make your character unique. They let you bend the rules for a specific skill in certain situations, grant a special mechanical benefit, or reflect mastery of a particular piece of gear or technique. Stunts are what make *your* Great (+4) Fight skill different from another character's.

**Starting Stunts**: You begin with three free Stunts.

**Additional Stunts**: Want more? You can take additional Stunts by reducing your character's Refresh score by one for each extra Stunt. However, your Refresh can never drop below 1.

**Creating Stunts**: The campaign ruleset provides some example Stunts like 'Titan-Kith Empathy' or 'Gravitic Anchor Boots.' Use these as inspiration! The best Stunts are those you create yourself (with GM approval) that perfectly fit your character's Aspects, skills, and their place in the world of Titan's Rest. Think about what makes your character special: specialized sky-ship maneuvers, unique ways of interacting with Titan flora/fauna, or mastery of a particular piece of Titan-derived technology.

**Thematic Emphasis**: Stunts should be thematic. A Zephyr Cartel pilot might have a Stunt for daring aerial maneuvers, while an Earthkin scholar could have one for deciphering ancient Titan glyphs. Make them cool, make them yours!


## Refresh Guide
**Title**: Step 4: Refresh - Fueling Your Fate

**Explanation**: Refresh is a measure of your character's narrative resilience and ability to influence the story through Fate Points. You start with a Refresh of 3.

**Adjustment For Stunts**: If you take more than the initial three free Stunts, your Refresh is reduced by 1 for each additional Stunt. For example, if you take four Stunts, your Refresh will be 2. If you take five Stunts, your Refresh will be 1. Your Refresh cannot go below 1.

**Function**: Your Refresh score determines the number of Fate Points you begin each game session with. Fate Points are the fuel for invoking Aspects and powering many Stunts, so a higher Refresh means more resources at the start of each adventure.


## Stress And Consequences Guide
**Title**: Step 5: Stress & Consequences - Weathering the Storm

**Explanation**: Adventures in Titan's Rest are dangerous! Stress tracks represent your character's ability to absorb temporary harm or strain before suffering more lasting effects (Consequences).

**Stress Tracks Intro**: You have three stress tracks:


### Physical Stress
**Description**: Represents cuts, bruises, exhaustion, and other physical harm.


### Mental Stress
**Description**: Represents fear, confusion, mental fatigue, and psychological strain.


### Titan Strain (Unique)
**Description**: A special stress track reflecting the profound physical and mental toll of extreme Titan environments, prolonged exposure to their alien energies, or the sheer psychological impact of their colossal scale and often incomprehensible nature.

**Base Boxes**: Each stress track starts with two stress boxes (a 1-point box and a 2-point box).

**Bonus Boxes**: Certain skills enhance your resilience:
*   **Physique:** At Fair (+2) or Good (+3), you gain a third physical stress box (a 3-point box). At Great (+4) or Superb (+5), you gain both a third and a fourth physical stress box (a 4-point box).
*   **Will:** At Fair (+2) or Good (+3), you gain a third mental stress box. At Great (+4) or Superb (+5), you gain both a third and a fourth mental stress box.
*   **Resolve:** At Fair (+2) or Good (+3), you gain a third Titan Strain stress box. At Great (+4) or Superb (+5), you gain both a third and a fourth Titan Strain stress box.

**Consequences Intro**: If you take more stress than you have boxes to absorb, you must take a Consequence or be 'Taken Out' of the scene. Consequences are new, temporary negative Aspects that represent more serious injuries or disadvantages.

**Consequence Slots**: You have slots for Mild (absorbs 2 shifts of harm), Moderate (absorbs 4 shifts), and Severe (absorbs 6 shifts) Consequences.

**Titan Strain Consequences**: Consequences from Titan Strain are often particularly narrative and can be transformative, reflecting the alien influence of the Titans (e.g., 'Whispers in the Dark,' 'Glowing Chitinous Growth,' 'Unsettling Titan Dreams'). These also act as compel-able Aspects!


## Final Touches
**Title**: Final Touches: Name and Details

**Text**: Give your character a name that fits the world of Titan's Rest! Perhaps something reflecting their culture (like an Earthkin nature-name or a Zephyr Cartel professional title) or their personal history. Add any other descriptive details – appearance, mannerisms, quirks – that help bring them to life. What does their voice sound like? How do they carry themselves when climbing a Titan's flank or navigating a bustling sky-port?


## Example Characters
**Title**: Example Character Snippets

**Intro**: Here are a couple of quick concepts to illustrate how these pieces might come together:


### Lyra 'Skytouch' Vance
**High Concept**: Daredevil Zephyr Cartel Explorer Pilot

**Trouble**: Haunted by the Loss of My First Sky-Ship, 'The Wanderer'

**Key Skill Stunt Idea**: Peak Skill: Drive/Pilot (+4). Stunt Idea: 'Thread the Needle' - Once per session, when piloting a sky-ship through exceptionally tight or dangerous spaces, spend a Fate Point to succeed with style on an Overcome roll instead of just succeeding.


### Kaelen 'Stonehand'
**High Concept**: Stoic Geocrag Crystal Dowser

**Trouble**: My Family is Deep in Debt to a Ruthless Mining Guild

**Key Skill Stunt Idea**: Peak Skill: Investigate (+4). Stunt Idea: 'Resonance Seeker' - When using Investigate to specifically locate rare crystals or mineral deposits within a Titan, gain +2 to your roll.
