**Ruleset Name**: Saga_Of_The_Sky_Titans_Rules_v1


## Core Mechanics
**Dice And Ladder**: All actions are resolved using four Fate Dice (yielding results from -4 to +4) added to a relevant Skill rating. This total is compared against a difficulty or an opponent's roll, interpreted using the standard Fate Ladder (e.g., +0 Average, +2 Fair, +4 Good).


### The Four Actions
**Overcome**: Used to surmount obstacles or achieve goals in the face of opposition or difficulty. Examples: Navigating treacherous Titan-back terrain, deciphering ancient Titan-sympathetic glyphs, persuading a wary Titan-dweller community.

**Create An Advantage**: Used to establish beneficial situational Aspects or discover existing ones. These aspects can be invoked later for a bonus. Examples: 'Dislodged Chitin Plate' on a creature for a tactical edge, 'Hidden Geyser Vent' for a quick escape, 'Favorable Wind Current' for sky-sailing.

**Attack**: Used in conflicts to inflict Stress (physical, mental, or environmental) on an opponent or target. Examples: Striking a monstrous Titan-parasite, launching a demoralizing verbal tirade against a rival scavenger leader, sabotaging a hostile faction's sky-skiff.

**Defend**: Used to avoid attacks, resist harmful Create an Advantage attempts, or protect against other negative outcomes. Examples: Dodging a falling stalactite during a Titan tremor, resisting intimidation from a Titan cultist, shielding allies from a sudden Aetheric discharge.


### Aspects And Fate Points
**Aspects In Play**: Aspects are core descriptive truths about characters, the environment (e.g., 'Rumbling Underside,' 'Corrosive Spore Cloud'), gear, or situations. They are the narrative currency of the game.

**Invoking Aspects**: Spend a Fate Point to gain a +2 bonus to a roll, reroll all four dice, or add +2 to a passive opposition, provided the aspect is relevant. Multiple aspects can be invoked on a single roll, each costing one Fate Point.

**Compelling Aspects**: The GM (or players, with GM approval) can highlight an aspect to introduce a complication relevant to it. The character whose aspect is compelled receives a Fate Point. Players can pay a Fate Point to refuse a compel if the aspect is their own.

**Fate Point Economy**: Players start each session with Fate Points equal to their character's Refresh rate. They are earned through compels, conceding conflicts, and sometimes for significant character achievements or roleplaying.

**Skills And Stunts In Play**: Character capabilities are defined by a list of Skills, each with a rating. Stunts are special exceptions or unique effects tied to skills, allowing characters to bend or break rules in specific ways, often at the cost of a Fate Point or under specific narrative circumstances.


## Conflict And Challenges
**Scene Framing And Zones**: Action scenes are often divided into abstract Zones representing distinct areas. Moving between zones can be free or require an Overcome action if obstacles or distances are significant. The GM establishes zones and their relevant aspects.

**Initiative And Turns**: In conflicts, turn order is typically determined by comparing relevant skills (e.g., Alertness, Empathy, or specific combat skills like Skirmish). On their turn, a character takes one of the Four Actions.


### Stress Tracks
**Types**: Characters have Physical and Mental stress tracks. Some large entities or complex situations might have their own thematic stress tracks (e.g., 'Settlement Stability,' 'Sky-Skiff Integrity').

**Capacity**: Base stress tracks have two boxes (1-point, 2-point). Physique skill improves Physical stress (Good/Great adds a 3-box, Superb+ adds a 4-box). Will skill similarly improves Mental stress.

**Absorbing Harm**: A successful Attack inflicts stress equal to the shifts generated (Attack roll - Defend roll). The target marks off stress boxes. If a 3-shift hit is taken, the 1 and 2 boxes could be marked, or just a 3-box if available.


### Consequences
**Purpose**: To absorb stress that exceeds available boxes or to strategically reduce incoming stress. Taking a consequence creates a new, temporary negative aspect for the character.

**Severity And Impact**: Mild (absorbs 2 shifts), Moderate (absorbs 4 shifts), Severe (absorbs 6 shifts). These aspects can be invoked or compelled against the character.

**Recovery**: Stress recovers quickly after a scene where it was taken. Consequences require specific narrative actions and successful Overcome rolls against difficulties related to their severity, often during downtime.


### Being Taken Out And Conceding
**Taken Out**: If a character cannot absorb all stress from an attack, even with available consequence slots, they are Taken Out. The attacker determines the narrative outcome (captured, knocked unconscious, demoralized, etc.), though permanent character death is rare without player consent.

**Conceding**: A player can choose to concede the conflict before an opponent's roll. The character is removed from the conflict but the player narrates how they lose and gains a Fate Point, plus an additional Fate Point for each consequence taken in that conflict. This offers more narrative control over defeat.


### Contests And Challenges
**Contests**: For opposed actions over several exchanges where success is not guaranteed for either side (e.g., a chase across a Titan's back, a prolonged debate). Participants make relevant skill rolls; victory goes to the first to achieve a set number of successes over their opponent.

**Challenges**: A series of Overcome actions needed to achieve a larger goal (e.g., navigating a dangerous Titan migration path, repairing vital settlement machinery). Each failed roll can introduce a complication or delay, while successes contribute to overall progress.


## Magic Resonance And Titan Symbiosis
**Nature Of Magic**: Known as 'Resonance Weaving' or 'Titan-Song Harmony,' this power involves attuning to and subtly manipulating the Aetheric energies flowing from the Titans, their unique biomes, or the ley lines across their vast bodies.

**Core Skill Weaving**: The 'Weaving' skill is paramount for most magical effects. Knowledge skills like 'Titan Lore' or 'Forbidden Ecology' often complement Weaving to understand and interact with specific magical phenomena or Titan-related entities.


### Casting As Fate Actions
**Overcome With Weaving**: Dispel minor hostile enchantments, navigate Aetheric currents, coax a Titan-flora to bloom out of season, or calm agitated lesser Titan-fauna.

**Create An Advantage With Weaving**: Manifest 'Illusory Terrain,' imbue an ally with 'Symbiotic Vigor,' place a 'Dissonant Aura' on an enemy, or discover a 'Hidden Resonance Locus.'

**Attack With Weaving**: Unleash 'Aetheric Javelins,' create 'Constricting Bio-Vines,' or inflict 'Psychic Static' (mental attack).

**Defend With Weaving**: Erect 'Kinetic Barriers,' 'Scatter Hostile Energies,' or use 'Precognitive Echoes' to anticipate an opponent's move.

**Costs And Limitations**: Powerful or complex Weaving may require: spending Fate Points, creating prerequisite advantages (e.g., 'Attuned to the Titan's Heartbeat'), accepting mental stress (e.g., 'Resonance Backlash'), or consuming rare Titan-derived reagents. Some rituals may involve extended challenges and specific environmental conditions (e.g., 'During a Titan's Sigh').


## Titan Centric Mechanics
**The Living World**: The Titan upon which the campaign primarily occurs is a dynamic environment. Its current mood, health, or activity (e.g., 'Titan is Dreaming,' 'Plagued by Sky-Leeches,' 'Navigating Asteroid Field') functions as a powerful, overarching Situation Aspect, influencing scenes, challenges, and resource availability.


### Titan Phenomena And Hazards
**Movement And Environment Shifts**: A Titan's movement (e.g., 'Sudden Lurch,' 'Altitude Change,' 'Entering Volcanic Plume') is a GM-initiated event, often creating immediate hazards. Characters might need to make Overcome rolls (using skills like Athletics, Alertness, or even Pilot for vehicles) to maintain footing, secure vital supplies, or avoid environmental damage. These events can change zone layouts or introduce new aspects to the scene.

**Titan Specific Hazards**: Examples include: 'Shifting Chitin Plates,' 'Acidic Rain from Titan Glands,' 'Parasitic Swarm Eruption,' 'Localized Gravitic Anomaly.' These can be passive environmental threats requiring Defend actions or active 'attacks' by the environment itself.

**Influencing The Colossus**: Direct control of a Titan is impossible. However, players might undertake epic 'Challenges' or 'Contests' using combined skills (Weaving, Titan Lore, Diplomacy, Survival) to achieve significant feats like 'Guiding the Titan Away from a Void Chasm,' 'Calming a Titan's Agony,' or 'Activating Ancient Geo-Steering Wards.' Success creates major narrative shifts and new campaign aspects.


### Resource Management And Scavenging
**Essential Resources**: Food, potable water, Titan-chitin for construction, bio-luminescent flora for light, medicinal herbs, Aether-resonant crystals for Weaving, salvageable remnants of past Titan-civilizations.

**Gathering Actions**: Typically involves Overcome actions using skills such as 'Scavenge,' 'Survival,' 'Titan Lore' (for rare biological components), or 'Craft' (for careful extraction or processing). Difficulty is set by resource rarity, location danger, and Titan mood aspects.

**Sustainability And Consequences**: Resource nodes can be depleted. Reckless harvesting can create negative Situation Aspects (e.g., 'Barren Hunting Grounds,' 'Enraged Territorial Beasts,' 'Unstable Ecosystem') or attract guardians or rival groups.


### Inter Titan Relations And Travel
**Sky Voyages**: Travel between known Titans requires specialized sky-skiffs, airships, or domesticated/symbiotic flying Titan-fauna. Such journeys are 'Challenges' using skills like 'Sky-Navigation,' 'Pilot,' 'Weaving' (for Aetheric currents), and 'Survival' (for airborne hazards). Encounters with sky-predators, pirates, or atmospheric storms are common.

**Titan Encounters And Conflict**: When Titans meet, the results are world-shaking. These events are massive backdrops for player action. Characters might focus on: 'Boarding Actions' against rival Titan-settlements, 'Desperate Defense' of their own Titan's vulnerable points, or 'Exploiting Chaos' to achieve specific objectives. The environment itself becomes extremely hazardous with pervasive aspects like 'Colliding Landmasses,' 'Aetheric Shockwaves,' and 'Falling Debris.'

**Diplomacy And Trade With Other Titans**: Not all inter-Titan contact is hostile. Establishing trade routes or alliances with communities on other Titans can be complex 'Challenges' or 'Contests' relying on 'Diplomacy,' 'Investigate' (to understand customs), and 'Resources' (to offer valuable goods).


## Additional Systems
**Health Of The Titan Community**: The well-being of the player characters' home settlement or community can be tracked via specific campaign aspects (e.g., 'Prospering Skyport,' 'Starving Outpost,' 'Plagued by Doubt'). Player actions and quest outcomes directly influence these aspects, changing the resources, support, and challenges the community faces.

**Scale And Focus**: While Titans are colossal, the rules focus on the characters' direct experiences and agency. Large-scale events are translated into personal challenges, threats, and opportunities for the PCs.

**Teamwork And Support**: Players can assist each other. The primary actor rolls their skill. Each helping player with at least Average (+1) in a relevant skill and a plausible way to contribute can grant a +1 bonus to the roll, typically capped at +2 or +3 from all helpers. Creating advantages for teammates is often a more potent form of support.
