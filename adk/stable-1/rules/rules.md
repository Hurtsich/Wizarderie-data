## Character Creation
**Summary**: Characters are defined by their unique Aspects, a pyramid of Skills, specialized Stunts, a Refresh rate determining Fate Point pool, Stress tracks for harm, and Consequence slots for lasting injuries.


### Aspects

#### High Concept
**Description**: A core phrase defining your character's essence and role in the world of Titans. Example: 'Resourceful Sky-Trader Navigating Titan Routes' or 'Veteran Titan-Climber Seeking Lost Lore'.


#### Trouble
**Description**: A personal flaw, recurring problem, or dangerous connection that complicates your character's life. Example: 'Hunted by the Sky-Pirate Clan ÅŒkaze' or 'Crippling Fear of Titan Maws'.


#### Titan-Forged Past (Phase 1)
**Description**: An aspect from a significant early adventure or defining moment shaped by life on or between Titans. Example: 'Sole Survivor of the Whispering Chasm Expedition'.


#### Crossed Paths (Phase 2)
**Description**: An aspect detailing a shared experience or relationship with another Player Character, forged amidst the challenges of the Titan world. Example: 'Saved by [Fellow PC] During the Great Upheaval of Titanus Minor'.


#### Skybound Ambition (Phase 3)
**Description**: An aspect reflecting a current goal, a driving ambition, or a significant recent event shaping your character's present actions. Example: 'Determined to Chart a Safe Passage to the Legendary Sky-Titan Atla'.

**Guidance**: Aspects are central to gameplay. Invoke them by spending a Fate Point for a +2 bonus or a re-roll. The GM (or players) can compel Aspects to introduce complications, awarding a Fate Point to the affected player.


### Skills
**Distribution**: Characters start with skills in a pyramid: one Great (+4), two Good (+3), three Fair (+2), and four Average (+1) skills. All other skills are considered Mediocre (+0) unless improved through advancement.

**Skill List Reference**: Refer to the 'Skills_Titanborne' section for the campaign-specific skill list.


### Stunts
**Description**: Stunts are special abilities that grant unique mechanical benefits or allow characters to use skills in new ways, reflecting their unique talents or specialized gear adapted for the Titan environment. Characters begin with three free stunts.

**Additional Stunts**: A character may choose to take additional stunts by reducing their Refresh total by one for each extra stunt. Refresh cannot drop below 1.

**Creation Guideline**: Stunts should be thematically linked to the character's Aspects and skills, and relevant to the challenges of surviving and thriving on and between Titans.


### Refresh
**Initial Value**: 3

**Adjustment**: Reduced by 1 for each stunt taken beyond the initial three free stunts. The minimum Refresh is 1.

**Function**: Refresh determines the number of Fate Points a character starts each game session with. Unspent Fate Points beyond Refresh are lost between sessions.


### Stress Tracks

#### Physical Stress
**Description**: Represents temporary physical harm, exhaustion, or minor injuries.

**Base Boxes**: 2

**Bonus Boxes**: A character with Physique at Fair (+2) or Good (+3) gains a third physical stress box. Physique at Great (+4) or Superb (+5) grants both a third and a fourth physical stress box.


#### Mental Stress
**Description**: Represents mental fatigue, fear, or psychological strain.

**Base Boxes**: 2

**Bonus Boxes**: A character with Will at Fair (+2) or Good (+3) gains a third mental stress box. Will at Great (+4) or Superb (+5) grants both a third and a fourth mental stress box.


#### Titan Strain Stress
**Description**: A special stress track unique to this world, representing the physical and mental toll of extreme Titan environments, prolonged exposure to Titan energies, or the psychological impact of their colossal scale and alien nature.

**Base Boxes**: 2

**Bonus Boxes**: A character with Resolve at Fair (+2) or Good (+3) gains a third Titan Strain stress box. Resolve at Great (+4) or Superb (+5) grants both a third and a fourth Titan Strain stress box.


### Consequences
**Slots**:
- Mild (absorbs 2 shifts of harm)

- Moderate (absorbs 4 shifts of harm)

- Severe (absorbs 6 shifts of harm)

**Description**: When stress exceeds available boxes, a character must take a Consequence or be Taken Out. Consequences are new, temporary negative Aspects representing lasting harm.

**Additional Mild Slot**: A character with Physique or Will at Superb (+5) or higher gains an additional Mild consequence slot for that specific type of harm (Physical or Mental).

**Titan Strain Consequences**: Consequences from Titan Strain are often narrative and transformative, reflecting the alien influence of the Titans. Examples: 'Whispers in the Dark', 'Glowing Chitinous Growth', 'Unsettling Titan Dreams'. These also function as Aspects.


## Fate Points
**Description**: The currency of action and drama in the world of Titans.

**Usage**:
- Invoke an Aspect: Spend one Fate Point to gain a +2 to a skill roll, re-roll all four Fate Dice, or add +2 to a source of passive opposition.

- Power a Stunt: Many Stunts require spending a Fate Point for their powerful effects.

- Refuse a Compel: Spend one Fate Point to avoid the complication offered by a Compel (you do not gain a Fate Point in this case).

- Declare a Story Detail: Spend one Fate Point to introduce a minor, plausible fact or element into the scene that benefits the character. (e.g., 'Of course there's a patch of lumina-moss here, perfect for a quick torch').

**Earning**:
- Accepting a Compel: When an Aspect introduces a complication for your character, you gain a Fate Point.

- Hostile Invocation: If an opponent (usually the GM) spends a Fate Point to invoke one of your Aspects against you, you gain that Fate Point after the current exchange.

- Beginning of Session: Characters start each session with Fate Points equal to their Refresh.

- GM Awards: The GM may award Fate Points for excellent roleplaying, clever plans, or embracing the themes of the game.

## Actions And Outcomes
**Description**: Whenever a character attempts something where the outcome is uncertain and failure has interesting consequences, they make a skill roll. The core FATE actions define what they can attempt.


### Overcome
**Description**: Used to surmount an obstacle or achieve a specific goal against passive opposition or a set difficulty. Example: Using Athletics to climb a 'Jagged Titan Spine' (Situation Aspect).


### Create an Advantage
**Description**: Used to create a new Situation Aspect or discover and gain free invocations on an existing one. Example: Using Notice to spot 'Unstable Footing' on a battlefield, or Academics to identify a 'Vulnerable Bioluminescent Organ' on a Titan beast.


### Attack
**Description**: Used to inflict harm (physical, mental, or Titan Strain) or take someone out in a conflict. Example: Using Shoot to fire a sky-harpoon at an 'Aggressive Sky-Serpent'.


### Defend
**Description**: Used as a reaction to resist an Attack or someone trying to Create an Advantage against you. Example: Using Pilot to evade an attack on your sky-ship.


### Fail (Roll < Opposition)
**Description**: The character does not achieve their goal, and may suffer a negative consequence or the situation worsens. Example: Failing an Athletics roll to leap a chasm means you fall, potentially taking stress or facing a new problem.


### Tie (Roll = Opposition)
**Description**: The character achieves their goal but at a minor cost, or the GM offers success with a complication. Example: Tying a Deceive roll to bluff past a guard might mean you get through, but the guard is now 'Suspicious'.


### Succeed (Roll > Opposition)
**Description**: The character achieves their goal without unintended negative consequences.


### Succeed with Style (Roll > Opposition by 3+ shifts)
**Description**: The character achieves their goal and gains an additional benefit, such as creating a free Boost (a temporary Aspect) or inflicting greater effect. Example: Succeeding with style on an Attack might inflict extra stress or create an advantage like 'Disarmed'.


## Conflict
**Description**: Conflicts occur when characters directly oppose each other with harmful intent, whether in a sky-ship battle, a tense negotiation, or a fight against Titan monstrosities.

**Zones**: Abstract areas representing relative positioning. Examples: 'Bridge of the Sky-Ship', 'Underbelly of the Titan Leech', 'Within Harpoon Range', 'Dense Spore Forest'. Moving between zones may require an Overcome action.

**Turns And Initiative**: Conflicts are structured in rounds, with characters taking turns. Initiative is typically determined by the most relevant skill for the situation (e.g., Notice for ambushes, Pilot for sky-ship combat, Empathy for social conflicts). The GM may opt for narrative initiative.

**Exchanges**: On their turn, a character can perform one of the Four Actions. This might be an Attack, an attempt to Create an Advantage, or an Overcome action to change the situation or escape.

**Damage And Stress**: Successful attacks inflict stress equal to the shifts of success. This stress is marked off on the relevant stress track (Physical, Mental, or Titan Strain). If all boxes on a track are filled, the character must take a Consequence or be Taken Out.

**Consequences In Conflict**: A character can choose to take a Consequence to absorb shifts from an attack, reducing or negating the stress taken. Consequences are new negative Aspects that their opponents can invoke.

**Taken Out**: When a character cannot or chooses not to absorb further stress or Consequences, they are Taken Out. The player whose character delivered the final blow narrates the outcome, within the fiction (e.g., captured, forced to flee, knocked unconscious, rendered compliant in a social conflict).


## Titan Specific Rules

### Titan Movement And Environment
**Description**: The colossal Titans are in perpetual, albeit slow, motion. Their movements and unique physiologies create dynamic and hazardous environments.

**Mechanics**:
- GM introduces Situation Aspects reflecting Titan activity: 'Sudden Titan Lurch', 'Grinding Tectonic Plates', 'Shifting Ecosystem Boundaries', 'Anomalous Energy Field'.

- Characters may need to make Overcome rolls (e.g., Athletics to maintain footing, Pilot to navigate sudden sky-currents) or risk facing environmental hazards.

- Major Titan events (e.g., a Titan awakening, colliding with another, shedding large parts of its 'skin') are significant story drivers, creating widespread challenges and opportunities. These can be modeled as large-scale Contests or Challenges.


### Inter Titan Travel

#### Sky Ships
**Description**: The primary means of long-distance travel and trade between Titans. Sky-ships can be treated as characters with their own Aspects (e.g., 'Clumsy but Durable Cargo Hauler', 'Swift Wind-Rider'), Skills (often represented by crew quality or specific ship systems like 'Reinforced Hull' or 'Long-Range Scanners'), Stress tracks, and Consequences.

**Operations**: Requires Drive/Pilot for maneuvering, Academics or Survival (Titan) for navigation through Titan-wakes and peculiar atmospheric phenomena, Shoot for ship-to-ship combat, and Crafts for repairs.

**Hazards**: Atmospheric storms between Titans, territorial aerial megafauna, sky-pirate ambushes, navigating 'Titan Shadows' (areas of distorted reality or strange energy), resource depletion (fuel, provisions).

**Creating Advantage With Ships**: Use Pilot to gain 'Higher Altitude Advantage', or Academics to find a 'Hidden Sky-Current shortcut'.


#### Titan Climbing And Exploration
**Description**: A perilous method for accessing specific locations on a Titan, exploring its surface, or for covert infiltration. Usually involves significant risk.

**Mechanics**: Often resolved as an extended Overcome challenge using Athletics, Survival (Titan), and sometimes Crafts (to create or use specialized 'Titan-Scale Grappling Gear'). Each roll might represent hours or days of effort. Failure could mean falls, alerting dangerous Titan-native life, or becoming lost in alien landscapes.

**Titan Surface Aspects**: Challenges can be represented by Situation Aspects like 'Glass-Smooth Chitin Wall', 'Unstable Crystalline Growths', 'Corrosive Spore Vents', 'Territorial Sky-Leech Nests'.


### Titan Scale Challenges And Entities
**Description**: Interacting directly with the colossal Titans or truly immense Titan-native entities poses unique challenges beyond normal human scale.

**Mechanics**: These are often modeled as Contests, Conflicts against entities with massive stress capacities and unique Stunts/Aspects, or as multi-stage Challenges requiring the party to achieve several objectives. The 'scale' of the Titan itself can be an Aspect (e.g., 'Impossibly Vast', 'Ancient Indifference').

**Example Actions**: Using Academics to 'Find a Weak Point in the Titan's Outer Shell', Provoke to 'Distract the Colossal Sky-Whale', or a coordinated group effort to Create an Advantage like 'Titan Momentarily Stunned'.


## Special Abilities And The Arcane
**Description**: In the world of Saga of the Wandering Titans, overt 'magic' as traditionally understood is rare. Instead, extraordinary abilities often stem from deep symbiosis with Titan ecosystems, mastery of forgotten Titan-derived technologies, rare mutations from Titan energies, or profound psionic/empathic connections.

**Representation As Stunts**: These unique capabilities are primarily represented through Stunts. They should feel grounded in the world's unique nature.


### Titan-Kith Empathy
**Effect**: Once per session, you may use Empathy instead of Rapport or Provoke when interacting with a specific type of Titan-native creature (chosen when you take this stunt, e.g., Sky-Manta, Chitin-Crawler).


### Bio-Lume Channeler
**Effect**: By spending a Fate Point and succeeding on a Crafts roll (difficulty based on intensity), you can temporarily cause bioluminescent flora or minor Titan-grown crystals in your zone to flare brightly, creating an advantage like 'Blinding Flare' or 'Area Illuminated'.


### Gravitic Anchor Boots
**Effect**: You treat 'Unstable Ground' or 'Sudden Lurch' aspects caused by Titan movement as if they had one less free invoke against you for Athletics rolls to keep your footing, provided your specialized boots are active.


### Sky-Sail Intuition
**Effect**: When Piloting a sky-ship, spend a Fate Point to automatically succeed with one shift on an Overcome roll to navigate through predictable sky-currents or minor atmospheric disturbances.

**Discovery And Risk**: Such abilities are not commonplace. They might be discovered through perilous exposure to Titan phenomena, by studying ancient Titan artifacts, or passed down through isolated communities. Using them might sometimes attract unwanted attention or have narrative costs, often tied to compels on Trouble aspects or by taking Titan Strain.


## Advancement
**Description**: Characters grow and change through their experiences, represented by milestones achieved during the campaign.


### Significant Milestone
**Trigger**: Typically occurs at the end of a game session or after completing a single scenario or objective.

**Benefits**: Choose one: (1) Swap the ratings of any two skills. (2) Rename one Aspect to reflect recent events. (3) Purchase a new Stunt (this may reduce Refresh if you are out of free Stunt slots). (4) Increase a skill by one step (up to the campaign's current maximum, usually Superb +5 initially).


### Major Milestone
**Trigger**: Occurs at the end of a major story arc or a significant series of scenarios.

**Benefits**: In addition to a Significant Milestone's benefits, gain one of the following: (1) Gain one point of Refresh (up to the starting value or a campaign cap). (2) Gain an additional skill point to raise a skill. (3) Rewrite a fundamental Aspect, like High Concept or Trouble, if dramatically appropriate.


### Critical Milestone
**Trigger**: Rare events that reshape the campaign or a character's core identity.

**Benefits**: These allow for more profound changes, such as raising the skill cap, fundamentally altering character capabilities, or gaining unique story-driven abilities beyond normal Stunts, as determined by the GM and player collaboration.
