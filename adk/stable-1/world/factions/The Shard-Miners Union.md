# The Shard-Miners Union
**Description**: The Shard-Miners Union is a highly organized and industrious faction singularly focused on the dangerous but immensely lucrative practice of mining rare crystals and concentrated resources directly from the bodies of active or dormant Titans, or from areas shattered by their colossal passage. They construct and operate modular, heavily armored mining platforms that can be anchored to or quickly relocated on Titan carapaces, adapting to the giants' movements. Their society is rigidly built on strict contracts, shared risk, and relentless technological innovation in extraction, processing, and defense. They often view Titans as colossal, inert resource deposits rather than living entities, which frequently leads to escalating conflict with factions like the Sky-Shepherds who hold the Titans sacred.
