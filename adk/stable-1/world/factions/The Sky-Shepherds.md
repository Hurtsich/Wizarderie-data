# The Sky-Shepherds
**Description**: The Sky-Shepherds are a nomadic faction that reveres the colossal, mobile Titans as sacred, ever-moving landscapes. They are master navigators of the perilous inter-Titan pathways and the complex, shifting surfaces of the giants, serving as vital guides, swift messengers, and traders of unique resources gathered from the Titans' trails. Their culture prioritizes agility, deep ancestral knowledge of Titan behavior, and living in sustainable harmony with their environment, often utilizing lightweight, easily collapsible dwellings and trained creatures adapted to the high winds and shifting terrain for travel and survival.


## Identity

- A shepherd's crook adorned with feathers


## Leadership
**Leaders**:
- The Elders of the Wind (a council of the most experienced navigators and lorekeepers)

**Structure**: Decentralized tribal confederation, guided by the Elders. Decisions are made through consensus and ancient rituals, emphasizing wisdom passed down through generations.

**Origin Story**: Long ago, desperate nomadic tribes recognized the inherent divinity of the Titans and the unique bounty they offered. They began to follow their paths, developing unparalleled techniques for survival and travel on their moving backs. Over countless generations, they formalized their roles as stewards and guides of the Titan-lands, forming the Sky-Shepherds.


## Membership

- Deep understanding of Titan lore and migratory patterns

- Exceptional navigation skills and physical agility

- Profound reverence for the Titans and their sacred paths

- Willingness to embrace a demanding nomadic lifestyle

- Successful completion of the 'Wind Walk' initiation ritual on a moving Titan

**Uniforms**:
- Lightweight, layered clothing made from durable, natural fibers, often dyed in earthy tones to blend with the Titan's surfaces

- Reinforced, grip-soled boots for climbing and traversing uneven terrain

- Wide-brimmed hats or hoods for protection against sun and wind

**Traditions**:
- Sky-Offering: Daily rituals performed at dawn and dusk, offering prayers and small tokens to honor the Titans and ensure safe passage.

- Pathfinding Chants: Complex songs and calls used to navigate, communicate across great distances on Titan surfaces, and subtly influence sky-creatures.

- Feather-Binding: A significant coming-of-age ritual where a youth, upon mastering a specific skill, binds a feather from a wild sky-creature to their cloak, symbolizing their mastery of wind and movement.


## Relations
**Allies**:
- Small, isolated communities dependent on their trade and guidance

- Certain 'Titan-touched' wild animal populations, which they often domesticate or guide

**Enemies**:
- The Shard-Miners Union (due to their differing views on Titans and resource exploitation)

- Large, aggressive predatory fauna of the Titan-lands


### The Shard-Miners Union
**Description**: The Sky-Shepherds view the Shard-Miners as destructive and disrespectful, scarring the sacred Titans for mere profit. They see their activities as a threat to the Titans' well-being and the natural balance of the moving world, leading to frequent skirmishes and acts of sabotage.

**Strength**: Strong

**Type**: Conflict


### Settlements at Titanfall Zones
**Description**: While primarily nomadic, the Sky-Shepherds maintain cautious but often positive relationships with static settlements near Titanfall Zones. They provide unique Titan-gathered resources and vital information on Titan movements in exchange for crafted goods, metals, and processed foods that are scarce in their moving world.

**Strength**: Moderate

**Type**: Trade/Mutual Dependence


## Status
**Current Status**: Thriving but constantly challenged by environmental unpredictability, resource scarcity, and the encroaching exploitation by factions like the Shard-Miners. Their unique knowledge and services remain highly valued across the Titan-lands.

**Resources**:
- Unique Titan-grown flora (e.g., medicinal herbs, bioluminescent moss)

- Rare fauna specific to Titan environments (e.g., resilient pelts, sky-creature eggs)

- Invaluable ancestral knowledge of safe routes and Titan behavior

- Trained sky-creatures used for aerial reconnaissance and transport

**Goals**:
- Preserve the sacredness and ecological balance of the Titans

- Maintain and pass down their nomadic lifestyle and ancestral knowledge

- Facilitate vital trade and communication across the vast and dangerous Titan-lands

- Defend Titan ecology and ancient traditions from exploitation and destruction


## The Wandering Steppes
**Description**: The Wandering Steppes is not a fixed geographical location, but rather the collective network of pathways, shifting plateaus, deep canyons, and sheltered valleys that exist across and between the backs of the walking Titans. It is the nomadic domain of the Sky-Shepherds, constantly changing with the Titans' movements.


### Geography
**Region**: The entirety of the Titan-lands, spanning various climate zones as Titans migrate and interact with the stationary world.

**Landscape**: Comprised of the Titans' rugged, often geologically active carapaces, featuring shifting plateaus, deep canyons carved by time and movement, and wind-swept plains. Occasional 'Titanfall' craters mark where a Titan has fallen and become dormant, creating temporary oases.

**Climate**: Highly variable and extreme, ranging from searing deserts to icy peaks, but consistently characterized by strong, unpredictable winds and rapid weather changes.

**Key Features**:
- Titan 'Spine-ridges': Colossal mountain ranges formed along the Titans' backs, often home to unique ecosystems.

- Carapace Forests: Unique biomes of specialized flora and fauna adapted to life on a moving Titan's surface.

- Sky-wells: Natural pools of water collecting in depressions on Titan surfaces, crucial for survival.

- Wind Tunnels: Natural pathways and currents between Titans, used for swift aerial travel.

**Points Of Interest**:
- Temporary Encampments: Lightweight, mobile settlements established in sheltered Titan crevasses.

- Ancient Titan-lore Markers: Carved symbols or arrangements of stones left by generations of Shepherds, guiding future paths.

- High-Altitude Lookout Points: Strategic vantage points on Titan peaks for navigation and observation.

**Threats**:
- Extreme and unpredictable weather patterns (e.g., sudden blizzards, windstorms)

- Large, aggressive predatory creatures adapted to Titan-life

- Rogue or unpredictable Titan movements (sudden shifts, tremors)

- Resource scarcity and the challenge of finding sustenance on a moving landmass
