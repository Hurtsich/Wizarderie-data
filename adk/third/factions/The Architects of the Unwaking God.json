  "name": "The Architects of the Unwaking God",
  "description": "A clandestine and highly skilled group of engineers, bio-mancers, and mystics who believe Titans are dormant god-like machines or biological constructs. They aim to repair, augment, or control Titans, potentially 'awakening' them or steering their movements, through invasive experiments and technological interfacing. They are widely feared and distrusted by most other factions.",

While the parent order revered Titans as unknowable, the proto-Architects, led by a figure known only as 'The First Artificer,' posited that Titans were constructsâ€”flawed, dormant, or incomplete. They were exiled for their blasphemous theories and dangerous experimental proposals, leading them to establish a clandestine network dedicated to proving their theories and ultimately 'perfecting' the Titans."
