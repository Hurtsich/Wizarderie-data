  "name": "The Earthshaker Covenant",
  "description": "A fervent religious cult that worships the Titans as primordial deities or divine manifestations. Their core belief is that the Titans' movements and states of being are omens or direct communications that must be interpreted and appeased. The Covenant is led by a High Seer or Oracle, who claims a direct connection to the 'Titan Mind,' with a hierarchy of priests and acolytes who perform rituals and spread their doctrine. Their bases are often remote temples built near significant Titan features (e.g., breathing vents, great hearts, or nerve clusters) or nomadic groups that follow specific Titans. They conduct elaborate sacrificial rituals (sometimes involving sentient beings), preach submission to the Titans' will, and fiercely oppose those who 'desecrate' or excessively exploit the Titans, often leading to violent clashes. Their relationship with Titans is one of absolute reverence and fear.",
