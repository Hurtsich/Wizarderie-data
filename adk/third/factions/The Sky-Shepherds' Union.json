  "name": "The Sky-Shepherds' Union",
  "description": "A faction composed of nomadic herders who raise and manage giant, sky-faring creatures native to the upper atmosphere or the Titans' exodermis. These creatures are sources of food, leather, transport, or other valuable biological products. The Union is a loose confederation of family clans, coordinating migration routes and sharing knowledge, with an intimate, respectful relationship with their specific Titan-associated fauna.",
  "identity": {
    "motto": "Where the Winds Blow, Our Herds Follow; In the Clouds, We Find Our Home.",

    "structure": "Loose confederation of family clans. Each clan is led by an elder Shepherd (often a matriarch or patriarch), with decisions made by consensus. The Council of Elder Shepherds, composed of representatives from prominent clans, coordinates major migration routes, shares vital knowledge, and mediates inter-clan disputes, but holds no direct authority over individual clans.",
    "origin_story": "The Sky-Shepherds' Union evolved from scattered groups of early Titan-dwellers who dared to venture into the perilous upper atmospheres. Through generations of keen observation, bravery, and hardship, they discovered, understood, and eventually formed symbiotic relationships with the colossal sky-faring creatures. Their ancestors learned to navigate the treacherous Void Wastes not as conquerors, but as partners with these magnificent beasts, forging a unique culture deeply intertwined with the winds and clouds."
