  "description": "A vast, militaristic empire aiming to unite all accessible Titans under a single banner. Their core philosophy is that only through unity and centralized control can civilization truly prosper and defend itself against the unpredictable nature of the Titans and external threats. The Imperium is known for its aggressive expansion, forced assimilation of cultures, heavy taxation, and large-scale resource extraction from Titans they control, viewing Titans primarily as resources and platforms for civilization.",

Warlord Artorias Maximus, through conquest and diplomacy, united the factions under his banner, proclaiming himself the First Emperor. He instilled the belief that only a unified humanity, spanning all Titans, could ensure survival and achieve greatness, a vision that has fueled centuries of relentless expansion."
