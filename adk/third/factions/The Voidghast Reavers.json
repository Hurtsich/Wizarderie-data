  "name": "The Voidghast Reavers",
  "description": "A disparate collection of raider clans and pirate fleets that prey on inter-Titan sky-ship traffic, especially targeting trade convoys and isolated settlements. Motivated by plunder, survival in the Void Wastes, and fierce independence, they operate from mobile flotillas or hidden bases, viewing Titans as hunting grounds.",
  "identity": {

    "origin_story": "The Voidghast Reavers emerged from the dregs of society – outcasts, mutineers, failed merchants, and refugees from destroyed settlements who found survival and a perverse sense of freedom in preying upon others. They coalesced in the lawless Void Wastes, forging a brutal culture centered on raiding and self-reliance. Many founding clans trace their lineage to legendary pirates of old."
