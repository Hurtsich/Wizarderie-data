  "name": "Atollon City, Coralia's Pearl Metropolis",
  "description": "Atollon City is a breathtakingly vibrant metropolis, the jewel of Coralia, seemingly grown rather than built from and within the colossal, living coral structures of the Titan. Buildings of countless hues, shaped from iridescent coral, rise from azure lagoons and cling to massive atoll ramparts, interconnected by a dazzling network of swaying rope bridges, sturdy coral-grown walkways, and intricate underwater tunnels illuminated by softly glowing bioluminescent organisms. Graceful gondolas, crafted from polished shells and lightweight coralwood, glide silently through a labyrinth of crystal-clear canals that serve as the city's main thoroughfares. Atollon is renowned across the Titans for its fearless pearl divers who plumb Coralia's depths for legendary gems, its exquisite and diverse seafood delicacies, unique and potent medicines derived from rare coral and marine life, and stunning artistry that masterfully utilizes natural bioluminescence to create living light sculptures and illuminated textiles. The entire city is a testament to adaptability, constantly shifting and evolving as its living foundations grow, retract, and reshape themselves in response to Coralia's subtle stirrings and the inexorable passage of time.",
  "geography": {
    "region": "The Great Central Lagoon System, Coralia",
    "landscape": "A sprawling city built upon a series of interconnected, massive living coral atolls and reef structures. Multi-hued coral buildings, some towering like organic spires, others nestled within protective coral formations. Intricate canal networks serve as streets, with underwater tunnels (lit by bioluminescent flora and fauna) offering deeper connections. Rope bridges and coral walkways span gaps between structures. Sections of the city are partially submerged, accessible by amphibious inhabitants or via dive bells. The city's layout is fluid, adapting to coral growth and Coralia's shifts.",
    "climate": "Tropical, warm, and humid year-round, with gentle sea breezes. Water in the canals and lagoons is consistently warm. Subject to Coralia's stirs which can cause localized tsunamis within the lagoons, strong currents, and reshaping of canals or submerged structures. Occasional 'Coral Blooms' can temporarily alter water clarity or bring new marine life.",
