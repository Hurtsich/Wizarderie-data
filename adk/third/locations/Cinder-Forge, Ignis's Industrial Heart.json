  "name": "Cinder-Forge, Ignis's Industrial Heart",
  "description": "Cinder-Forge is a colossal, heavily fortified industrial metropolis clawed into the volatile hide of Ignis, built with grim determination around a rare cluster of relatively stable geothermal vents and controlled magma flows. Its architecture is a brutalist masterpiece of black basalt, fire-hardened brick, and gleaming obsidian, with every structure designed to withstand the intense, perpetual heat and the frequent, bone-jarring tremors that wrack the Obsidian Wyrm Titan. Soaring smokestacks belch plumes of acrid smoke into the ash-choked sky, mingling with the fiery glow of countless forges. The city is a symphony of relentless industry: the deafening clang of colossal hammers shaping metal, the roar of smelters devouring raw ore, and the hiss of superheated steam power its myriad machines. Cinder-Forge is famed across the Titans for its unparalleled production of high-quality, exotic metal alloys, razor-sharp obsidian weaponry, and life-saving heat-resistant gear, all forged in the very maw of Ignis's fury. Life here is a harsh testament to resilience and ambition, a constant battle against the Titan's destructive power in pursuit of its fiery bounty.",
  "geography": {
    "region": "The Obsidian Plains, Ignis (specifically, the 'Caldera's Maw' district)",
    "landscape": "A multi-tiered city sprawling across several interconnected volcanic plateaus and delving deep into Ignis's crust. Built around a nexus of massive geothermal vents ('The Great Vents') and carefully channeled magma flows ('Magma Arteries'). Characterized by towering forge-complexes, sprawling ore-processing yards, obsidian quarry-pits within the city limits, fortified defensive walls embedded with obsidian shards, and deep, reinforced foundations. A network of underground 'Ore-Ways' and steam-powered lifts connects different sectors.",
    "climate": "Extreme heat is pervasive, with ambient temperatures capable of incapacitating the unprepared. The air is perpetually thick with volcanic smoke, ash, metallic dust, and sulfurous fumes from the forges and vents. Frequent tremors shake the city, and the ground itself often radiates intense heat. Acidic rain is a common hazard, especially downwind of major industrial zones. The glow from lava channels and forges casts an eternal, fiery twilight over the city.",

    "population": "Approximately 65,000 souls, making it one of the largest and most densely populated settlements on Ignis, though life expectancy can be short.",
    "typical_inhabitants": [
      "Dwarves (Dominate the master forges, engineering corps, and mining operations; many clans owe allegiance to the Iron Council)",
      "Ashlander Humans (Form the bulk of the workforce in less skilled labor, city guard, and obsidian quarrying; exceptionally hardy and heat-resistant)",
      "Fire Genasi (Often found as geothermal engineers, specialized smiths capable of working with extreme temperatures, or as advisors to the Iron Council)",
      "Kobolds (Toil in the most dangerous and cramped mining tunnels, often as indentured workers or scavenging communities in the city's underbelly)",
      "Azer (Bound fire elementals sometimes forced into labor in the deepest, hottest forges, or working under strict contracts)",
      "Gnomes (Few in number, but valued for their intricate work on heat-resistant mechanisms, cooling systems, and precision tools)",
