  "name": "Coralia, the Wandering Atoll Titan",
  "description": "Coralia is a colossal, living atoll, a reef-like Titan that drifts with majestic slowness through the vast, warm oceans of the world, or sometimes through a mysterious, misty 'under-sky' beneath the known cloud layers. Its surface is an intricate, ever-changing labyrinth of vibrant, multi-hued coral structures that form towering spires, protective reefs, and sprawling platforms. These are interspersed with tranquil, sun-drenched warm lagoons, mysterious deep blue holes that plummet into the Titan's watery innards, and extensive networks of underwater caverns accessible from both the surface and the depths. Coralia hosts an incredibly diverse marine ecosystem, unique to its own body, providing an abundance of lustrous pearls of myriad colors, exotic and nutritious seafood, and rare, bio-luminescent minerals that grow within its living coral shell. The cultures that thrive upon Coralia are inherently maritime, often amphibious, or heavily focused on advanced aquaculture, pearl diving, and inter-Titan trade via specialized, shallow-draft sky-skiffs or submersible vessels. When Coralia stirs, its movements are often subtle from afar, but on its surface, they can manifest as powerful, localized tsunamis that sweep across lagoons, or cause dramatic shifts in the seabed, reshaping its lagoons, opening new channels, or collapsing ancient caverns overnight.",
  "geography": {
    "region": "The Cerulean Drifts / The Shimmering Under-Sky Seas",
    "landscape": "Massive living coral atolls forming islands and archipelagos, shallow warm-water lagoons, deep blue sinkholes leading to internal cave systems, vibrant barrier reefs, bioluminescent coral gardens, mangrove-like coral forests along lagoon edges, extensive underwater cave networks, pearl beds in sheltered trenches, mineral-rich coral shell extrusions.",
    "climate": "Predominantly tropical and humid, with warm, balmy air and water temperatures. When drifting in the 'under-sky', it is perpetually misty and diffusely lit. Subject to sudden, localized tsunamis, rogue waves, and waterspouts generated by Coralia's movements or internal shifts. The water quality in lagoons is generally excellent but can be affected by stirs.",
