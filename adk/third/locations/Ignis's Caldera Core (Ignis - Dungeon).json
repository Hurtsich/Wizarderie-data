  "name": "Ignis's Caldera Core (Ignis - Dungeon)",
  "description": "Ignis's Caldera Core is a terrifying and deeply perilous network of interconnected volcanic tubes, searing magma chambers, and treacherous obsidian caves that inexorably wind their way towards the very heart of Ignis's primary, colossal caldera. This subterranean labyrinth is an intensely hazardous environment, where adventurers face constant threats from unbearable, oppressive heat that can melt steel, clouds of choking, toxic gases that erupt from unseen fissures, and encounters with volatile fire elementals that embody Ignis's fiery wrath. Sudden, unpredictable lava surges can instantly transform passages into molten deathtraps, and the ground itself often shudders with the Titan's barely contained power. Despite these extreme dangers, the Caldera Core is a place of legendary allure, whispered to contain veins of ultra-hard 'Firesteel' ore, coveted by smiths across the Titans; massive, energy-rich geothermal crystals that pulse with raw power; and, most terrifyingly, the rumored lair of a mighty and ancient Magma Drake, a beast of pure fire and fury said to guard the caldera's deepest secrets.",
  "geography": {
    "region": "Deep within Ignis, the Obsidian Wyrm Titan, leading to its primary active caldera.",
    "landscape": "A network of natural and magma-carved lava tubes, some wide enough for giants, others mere crawlspaces. Vast, irregularly shaped magma chambers with bubbling lakes of molten rock and precarious obsidian bridges. Caverns formed from rapidly cooled obsidian, featuring sharp, glass-like formations and fragile ledges. Geothermal vents spewing superheated steam and toxic gases. Areas of unstable, crumbling volcanic rock and ash-choked passages.",
    "climate": "Extreme, life-threatening heat throughout. Air quality is exceptionally poor, often saturated with sulfurous fumes, carbon dioxide, and other volcanic gases. Localized areas experience intense radiation from exposed magma. Visibility is often obscured by steam, smoke, and heat haze. The entire structure vibrates with Ignis's geothermal activity and the flow of magma.",
    "key_features": [
      "The Great Lava River: A major, active flow of molten rock that bisects sections of the Core, requiring dangerous crossings or detours.",
      "Obsidian Shard Caverns: Caves lined with razor-sharp obsidian formations, making movement treacherous.",
      "The Fumarole Maze: A complex of narrow, steam-filled passages with unpredictable jets of superheated gas.",
      "The Crystal Geode Chambers: Hidden caverns where massive geothermal crystals have formed, radiating intense energy and heat.",
      "The Magma Drake's Roost: A legendary, vast chamber near the caldera's edge, believed to be the lair of the ancient Magma Drake.",
      "The Firesteel Vein Passages: Sections of tunnel where the sought-after Firesteel ore is rumored to be exposed."

      "Extreme heat leading to rapid exhaustion, dehydration, and combustion of flammable materials.",

      "Geothermal explosions or steam vent eruptions.",
      "Getting lost in the labyrinthine, poorly mapped network of tunnels and caves.",
      "Magical wards or ancient traps left by previous denizens or Ignis itself."

      "Legends claim that Firesteel isn't just mined, but 'grown' or 'forged' by the Titan itself in specific, superheated chambers within the Core, requiring precise timing and rituals to harvest.",
      "There are tales of hidden 'Cool Vents' or 'Obsidian Sanctuaries' within the Core, offering temporary, miraculous respite from the heat, their locations a closely guarded secret among survivors.",
      "A persistent rumor suggests that the geothermal crystals within the Core can be used to temporarily control or influence lesser fire elementals, or even Ignis's minor stirrings."

      "The Obsidian Heart of Ignis: Not the Titan's actual heart, but a perfectly formed, fist-sized piece of obsidian found only in the deepest, hottest part of the Core, said to pulse with captured magma and grant visions of Ignis's depths.",
