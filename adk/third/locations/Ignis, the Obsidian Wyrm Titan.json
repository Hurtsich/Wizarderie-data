  "name": "Ignis, the Obsidian Wyrm Titan",
  "description": "Ignis, the Obsidian Wyrm Titan, is a terrifyingly majestic serpent of immense scale, its hide a shifting mosaic of razor-sharp black volcanic rock and gleaming, glass-like obsidian. It coils and slithers through the world with an erratic, unpredictable motion, its passage carving new chasms in the land below and spewing vast clouds of choking ash that can blot out the sun for weeks. The back of Ignis is a dynamic, hellish landscape: constantly active volcanic vents belch fire and smoke, rivers of molten lava flow like fiery serpents across its obsidian plains, and vast ash fields stretch for leagues, punctuated by bubbling geothermal springs that hiss with superheated steam. Despite its perilous nature, Ignis is incredibly rich in resources, boasting unparalleled deposits of rare ores, vast quantities of obsidian prized for tools and weapons, and boundless geothermal energy. The cultures that dare to exist upon its back are as hardy and unforgiving as the Titan itself, ranging from heavily industrialized city-states built to withstand the constant upheaval, to resilient nomadic tribes that have mastered the art of survival in this fiery crucible. When Ignis stirs, it is an event of cataclysmic proportions, manifesting as violent volcanic eruptions that reshape its surface in moments, and powerful earthquakes that can shatter settlements and send rivers of magma cascading through inhabited regions.",

  "demographics": {
    "population": "Approximately 150,000-250,000 souls, concentrated in a few fortified industrial settlements like Cinder-Forge, with numerous smaller nomadic groups and isolated mining outposts. Survival is a daily struggle, and population density is low compared to more hospitable Titans.",

Many smaller mining outposts are effectively autocracies or lawless zones controlled by the strongest warlord or company.",
    "ruling_power": "The Iron Council of Cinder-Forge (within the city), various Soot-Nomad Chieftains (across the ash fields), and numerous independent mining barons and warlords in less controlled territories. No single entity governs all of Ignis."

  "history": {
    "significance": "Ignis is a primal force of creation and destruction, a Titan whose bounty comes at a terrible price. Its erratic movements and violent stirs mean that civilizations upon its back are often short-lived or exist in a state of constant, precarious adaptation. It is widely viewed as a test of resilience and a symbol of raw, untamed power. Many believe Ignis's fires forge the strongest souls and the finest steel.",

      "The Obsidian Wars (Recurring periods of intense conflict between various factions—city-states, nomad clans, and mining guilds—over control of prime obsidian veins and ore-rich territories).",
      "The Year of Red Skies (A prolonged period of exceptionally violent volcanic activity on Ignis that darkened the skies for leagues, isolating it from inter-Titan trade and causing widespread famine and upheaval on its back).",
      "The Soot-Nomad Unification (A rare historical event where disparate nomadic tribes temporarily united under a single banner to survive a particularly devastating series of eruptions and migrations of Ignis)."

      "Some believe Ignis periodically sheds its outermost layer of obsidian 'scales' in remote, inaccessible regions, and these scales, if found, are imbued with immense elemental power.",
      "A persistent legend claims that Ignis is not merely a beast but a sentient prison for an ancient, fiery demigod or elemental lord, whose rage fuels its eruptions.",
