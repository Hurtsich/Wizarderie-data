  "name": "Petra, the Stone Colossus Titan",
  "description": "Petra is a gargantuan, ancient Titan of living rock, earth, and deep-running veins of precious ore, its form vaguely humanoid or quadrupedal, suggesting immense, slumbering power. Its back is a rugged, formidable expanse of towering, craggy mountain peaks that pierce the sky, deep, shadowed canyons carved by eons of elemental forces, and vast, rocky plateaus where only sparse, incredibly hardy vegetation can find purchase. This Titan is a treasure trove of geological wealth, rich in diverse types of stone, abundant metals from common iron to veins of rare adamantite, and the remarkably preserved fossils of colossal, ancient creatures embedded within its stony hide. The cultures that have arisen on Petra are as stoic and resilient as the Titan itself, renowned for their unparalleled mining prowess, intricate stonecraft that turns rock into art and impenetrable fortresses, and fortress-like cities carved directly into the mountainsides or deep within the earth. Petra moves with an immense, ponderous infrequency, its shifts often separated by decades or even centuries. However, when it does stir, the consequences are cataclysmic: massive earthquakes, dubbed 'Titanquakes,' ripple across its surface, capable of toppling even the most formidable settlements, reshaping entire mountain ranges overnight, and revealing new veins of ore or ancient, buried secrets.",
  "geography": {
    "region": "The Shifting Peaks / The Titan's Embrace",
    "landscape": "Towering mountain ranges (The Spine of Ages, The Granite Fangs), deep canyons (The Great Scar, Echoing Chasm), vast, rocky plateaus (The Barren Tablelands), exposed ore veins glittering on cliff faces, fossil-rich badlands, sparse, hardy scrublands, networks of deep, natural caverns and ancient lava tubes.",
    "climate": "Generally arid and harsh, with significant temperature variations between sun-baked plateaus and shadowed canyons or high-altitude peaks. Strong, erosive winds are common, especially funneling through canyons, often carrying dust and grit. Precipitation is infrequent, usually as sudden, violent downpours that can cause flash floods in canyons. Higher peaks are often snow-capped and bitterly cold.",
