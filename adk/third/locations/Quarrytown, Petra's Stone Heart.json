  "name": "Quarrytown, Petra's Stone Heart",
  "description": "Quarrytown is an industrious, sprawling city built with stark pragmatism directly into and around the colossal, actively worked Great Granite Quarry on the rocky back of Petra. Its architecture is a testament to functionality over aesthetics, with buildings carved from the Titan's own stone â€“ massive, angular blocks forming sturdy, unadorned structures. Homes, workshops, and municipal buildings cling to the quarry walls, descend in terraced levels into its depths, or stand defiantly on precarious rock pillars left behind by the miners. The air is perpetually filled with a fine stone dust, the rhythmic clang of picks and hammers, the screech of mining machinery, and the controlled blasts that herald new veins of ore or blocks of prized stone. Life in Quarrytown is undeniably hard, a constant struggle against the unyielding rock and the ever-present threat of Petra's frequent, though usually minor, tremors. The entire city is engineered with this instability in mind, featuring reinforced foundations, interlocking stone construction, and emergency tremor shelters carved deep into the most stable rock formations.",
  "geography": {
    "region": "The Granite Plateaus of Petra's Upper Back",
    "landscape": "A vast, open-pit quarry forming a series of deep, interconnected craters and sheer rock faces. The city is built on multiple levels within the quarry itself and on its rims. Features towering crane-like mining derricks, extensive networks of ore cart tracks and conveyor systems, massive spoil heaps of waste rock, and deep, echoing mine shafts plunging into Petra's depths. The quarry floor is a chaotic but organized maze of active mining faces, processing areas, and transport routes.",
    "climate": "Arid, dusty, and subject to Petra's harsh weather conditions. Extreme temperature variations between sun-exposed quarry faces and shadowed depths. Strong, gritty winds often whip through the quarry, carrying stone dust. Water is a precious commodity, mostly sourced from deep wells or transported in.",

  "economy": {
    "description": "Quarrytown's economy is entirely dependent on its primary industry: the relentless extraction of various ores (iron, copper, tin, silver, occasionally gold or mithral), valuable gemstones (diamonds, rubies, specialized 'Petra-Eyes'), and massive stone blocks for construction and export across the Titans. Life revolves around the mine shifts and the value of the day's haul. Barter of raw materials is common, but standardized metal tokens stamped by the Quarrymaster's Council serve as official currency.",
