  "name": "Riverbend Market, Kaskara's Trade Hub",
  "description": "Riverbend Market is a vibrant, sprawling, and perpetually shifting market town situated along the fertile banks of the Great Serpentcoil River, a major waterway that winds its sinuous path across Kaskara's verdant shell. This bustling settlement serves as a critical central trading post for numerous disparate Kaskaran communities, from deep forest hunters to upland grove tenders, and also boasts one of Kaskara's few well-established landing spots for sky-ships arriving from other Titans. The air hums with a cacophony of bartering voices, the scent of exotic fruits mingling with pungent herbs and freshly worked wood. Riverbend is famed across Kaskara and beyond for its succulent, sun-ripened exotic fruits, incredibly rare and valuable animal pelts sourced from Kaskara's deep wilds, uniquely potent medicinal herbs, and masterfully, intricately carved wooden goods. The entire town is a testament to adaptability; its architecture consists of stilt-houses, floating platforms, and easily dismantled stalls, all designed to cope with the Serpentcoil River's ever-changing course, a direct consequence of Kaskara's slow, deliberate movements that reshape the land.",
  "geography": {
    "region": "The Serpentcoil River Valley, Kaskara's Central Plains",
    "landscape": "A dynamic riverine environment with shifting sandbanks, temporary islets, wide muddy flats during low water, and lush, periodically flooded plains. The market itself is a patchwork of sturdier buildings on slightly higher ground, interconnected by raised walkways, and sprawling temporary vendor areas closer to the water's edge. Docks are often modular and repositionable.",
    "climate": "Warm, humid, and temperate, characteristic of Kaskara's broader climate, but with increased humidity from the river. Experiences seasonal water level changes, exacerbated by Kaskara's movements which can cause sudden bank erosion, course shifts, or localized flooding. Morning mists are common.",
    "key_features": [
      "The Great Serpentcoil River: A wide, powerful, and constantly meandering river, the lifeblood and primary shaper of the market.",
      "The Shifting Stalls District: The main marketplace area, where vendors erect temporary stalls that are frequently moved as the riverbank changes.",
      "Sky-Sailor's Bluff: A relatively stable escarpment overlooking a wider bend in the river, reinforced for sky-ship landings and departures.",
      "The Old Riverbed Scar: A dry, wide depression marking a previous course of the Serpentcoil, now used for larger gatherings or temporary storage.",
      "The Floating Docks: A network of interconnected rafts and pontoons that serve as the primary docking area for riverboats, adjusting to water levels.",
      "The Mud-Skip Paths: Treacherous but quick routes across exposed mudflats during low water, known only to locals."
