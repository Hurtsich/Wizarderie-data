  "name": "Soot-Nomads' Encampment (Ignis)",
  "description": "The Soot-Nomads' Encampment is not a fixed location but a constantly shifting, mobile community that epitomizes survival on the volatile surface of Ignis. It typically consists of a laager of heavily armored wagons, their thick plates scarred by heat and shrapnel, designed to withstand ash storms and minor tremors. For longer stays or during significant eruptions, the nomads excavate temporary subterranean shelters – 'ash-burrows' or expanded lava tubes – offering crucial protection from Ignis's fury. These resilient people are expert survivalists, resourceful scavengers, and skilled miners, constantly following Ignis's more geologically stable regions to extract rare minerals or venturing into recently devastated areas to salvage what they can. They are renowned as unparalleled guides across Ignis's treacherous, ever-changing landscapes and are often the primary source of up-to-date intelligence on the Titan's current state, its new lava flows, active vents, and seismic temperament, trading this invaluable information for essential supplies.",
  "geography": {
    "region": "The Unstable Territories of Ignis (e.g., Ashfall Wastes, Obsidian Plains, Geyser Fields – wherever Ignis's current stirrings permit and resources beckon).",
    "landscape": "A temporary, mobile settlement. Key features include a defensive circle of armored wagons, entrances to hastily dug subterranean shelters, makeshift forges for urgent repairs and toolmaking, designated areas for processing scavenged materials, and temporary pens for their hardy, heat-resistant beasts of burden. The immediate surroundings are typical of Ignis: volcanic plains, ash dunes, fields of obsidian shards, cooling lava flows, and steaming geothermal vents, constantly shifting due to the Titan's activity.",
    "climate": "Subject to Ignis's extreme and unpredictable climate: intense heat, pervasive ash-laden air, sulfurous fumes, frequent seismic tremors, and the constant threat of lava flows or pyroclastic events. Shelters provide essential respite. The nomads are adept at reading atmospheric signs to predict localized hazards.",

  "demographics": {
    "population": "Fluid and dispersed. Typically consists of several independent caravans, each numbering from 50 to 300 individuals. These caravans may occasionally converge at temporary rally points, swelling numbers to over a thousand for brief periods of trade or council.",

      "Ashlander Humans (Dominant group, with generations of adaptation to Ignis's harsh conditions, known for their resilience and survival skills).",

  "government": {
    "type": "Tribal and meritocratic. Each caravan is typically led by an elected 'Trail Boss' or 'Caravan Chieftain,' chosen for their proven survival skills, wisdom, navigational expertise, and ability to find resources. The Chieftain is advised by a council of elders, comprising experienced scouts, master artisans, formidable warriors, and respected 'Vein-Finders' or 'Ash-Readers'.",
    "ruling_power": "The Caravan Chieftain and the Council of Elders. Decisions are pragmatic, focused on immediate survival, resource acquisition, and the safety of the caravan. Consensus is preferred, but the Chieftain often has final say in critical situations."

  "economy": {
    "description": "A precarious economy based on subsistence, expert scavenging, opportunistic mining of rare and valuable minerals from dangerous or temporary locations, and the trade of vital information and guide services.

They are the keepers of generations of survival lore specific to the Obsidian Wyrm, understanding its rhythms and dangers better than any sedentary population. Their existence is a testament to resilience, resourcefulness, and an intimate, albeit perilous, relationship with their Titan host. They often act as the first warning system for major Ignis stirs that might affect other settlements.",
