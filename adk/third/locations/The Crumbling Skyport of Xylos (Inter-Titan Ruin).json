  "name": "The Crumbling Skyport of Xylos (Inter-Titan Ruin)",
  "description": "The Crumbling Skyport of Xylos is a stark monument to a forgotten era of ambition and prosperity, now reduced to decaying ruins clinging precariously to a massive rock outcrop jutting from the scarred flank of Xylos, a lesser, long-dormant Titan. Once a grand nexus for inter-Titan sky-ship travel, its docking arms are now collapsed and twisted metal skeletons, its control towers lean at impossible angles, and its grand halls are exposed to the harsh elements of the upper atmosphere. Ravaged by the relentless passage of time, savage weather, and the tremors of past Titan-stirs (both from Xylos itself in its dying throes and from nearby behemoths), the Skyport is a treacherous labyrinth of crumbling masonry, unstable platforms, and dark, forgotten corridors. It has become an infamous haven for sky-pirates who use its shattered silhouette to ambush unwary vessels, desperate scavengers picking through its bones for lost technology, and opportunistic, hardy creatures that prey on anyone foolish or unfortunate enough to seek a temporary, albeit extremely dangerous, stopover between the relative safety of major Titans. The wind howls through its broken structures, carrying whispers of its former glory and the groans of decaying metal, a constant lament for its fall.",
