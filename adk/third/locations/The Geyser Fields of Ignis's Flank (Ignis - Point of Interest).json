  "name": "The Geyser Fields of Ignis's Flank (Ignis - Point of Interest)",
  "description": "The Geyser Fields of Ignis's Flank are a vast, treacherous expanse on the Obsidian Wyrm Titan, an unstable plain defined by hundreds of geothermal geysers that erupt with terrifying unpredictability, spewing scalding water, superheated steam, and mineral-rich debris. The ground is a chaotic mosaic of steaming fissures, bubbling hot springs, sulfurous pools, and fragile crusts that can collapse without warning into boiling mud or hidden lava tubes. Despite the omnipresent danger, the Fields are a coveted source of rare minerals, deposited in vibrant, crystalline layers by the geyser activity. It is also a perilous hunting ground for unique creatures that have adapted to thrive in the extreme heat and moisture, their hides often infused with the very minerals they tread upon. The air is thick with the roar of erupting geysers, the hiss of steam vents, and the acrid scent of sulfur, making it a disorienting and deadly frontier for even the hardiest souls.",
  "geography": {
    "region": "The Unstable Flanks of Ignis, often bordering the Ashfall Wastes.",
    "landscape": "A geothermal plain dominated by hundreds of active geysers of varying sizes and eruption cycles. Features include extensive mineral terraces built up by geyser deposits, sulfurous mud pots, steaming hot springs, deep, unstable fissures, fragile sinter crusts, and scattered fields of volcanic pumice and obsidian shards ejected by eruptions. The ground is constantly shifting and reforming.",
    "climate": "Extremely hot and humid, with localized superheated zones around active geysers and steam vents. The air is thick with steam, sulfurous fumes (SO2, H2S), and acidic mists, drastically reducing visibility and posing respiratory hazards. The ground radiates intense heat, and sudden temperature spikes accompany geyser eruptions. 'Scald-Rain' (condensed, superheated, mineral-laden water) is a frequent hazard.",

      "The 'Old Faithful's Fury' (A massive, somewhat predictable geyser known for its towering eruptions).",
      "The Sulfur Vents of Vol'kar (A cluster of fumaroles emitting concentrated toxic gases and depositing bright yellow sulfur crystals).",
      "The Crystalline Terraces of Ignis's Tears (Multi-hued mineral formations created by evaporated geyser water, rich in rare compounds).",
      "The Tremor Flats (A particularly unstable area where the ground constantly shudders and fissures open and close).",
      "The Steam-Worn Ravines (Channels carved by repeated flows of superheated water, often hiding mineral veins or creature lairs).",

      "The Hidden Steam Caves (Naturally formed caves behind geyser curtains, sometimes containing crystallized minerals or offering temporary shelter).",
      "The Soot-Nomad 'Offering Stone' (A landmark where Soot-Nomads leave offerings before daring to enter the Fields).",
      "The 'Sulfur Bloom' Geode Field (An area where hollow, sulfur-lined geodes are frequently found after minor eruptions)."

    "threats": [
      "Unpredictable geyser eruptions (scalding water, steam blasts, high-velocity rock debris, concussive force).",

      "Extreme heat, dehydration, and heatstroke.",
      "Toxic and asphyxiating volcanic gases.",
      "Poor visibility due to steam and ash, leading to disorientation.",
      "Territorial heat-adapted creatures (e.g., Ignis Salamanders, Cinder Geckos, Steam Mephits, Sulfur Beetles, Acidic Slimes, possibly lesser Fire Elementals).",
