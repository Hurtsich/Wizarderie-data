  "name": "The Kelp Warrens (Coralia)",
  "description": "The Kelp Warrens are a hidden, partially submerged settlement ingeniously nestled within dense, towering kelp forests that cloak Coralia's flanks and fill its deeper, less accessible lagoons. This secretive community is inhabited by the Kelpfolk, an amphibious culture possessing unparalleled skills in underwater survival. They are renowned for harvesting rare aquatic herbs with potent properties, taming the diverse local marine life to serve as companions and guardians, and navigating the labyrinthine underwater passages of Coralia. The Kelp Warrens serve as a clandestine trading post for these unique resources and offer expert guidance through Coralia's treacherous submerged landscapes to those few who can find them and earn their trust.",
  "geography": {
    "region": "The Shadowed Kelp Beds of Coralia's Flanks and Deeper Lagoons",
    "landscape": "An intricate, multi-layered environment dominated by colossal kelp fronds that form natural walls, ceilings, and hidden chambers. Structures are woven from living kelp, reinforced with driftwood, salvaged coral, and hardened sea-silk. Bioluminescent algae and symbiotic glowing organisms clinging to the kelp provide a dim, ethereal illumination. Underwater caves within the kelp's holdfasts or Coralia's own hide offer deeper shelter. The warrens are a maze of swaying fronds, narrow passages, and sheltered clearings.",
    "climate": "Submerged sections are consistently cool and dimly lit, with visibility often obscured by dense kelp. Surface-level pockets within the warrens are tropical and humid, but perpetually shaded by the towering kelp canopy. Strong, sometimes unpredictable currents flow through the warrens, influenced by Coralia's movements and the tide. Water clarity varies, being clearest in sheltered groves and murkier in denser thickets.",
