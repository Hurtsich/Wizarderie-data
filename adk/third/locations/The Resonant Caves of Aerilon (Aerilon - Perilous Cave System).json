  "name": "The Resonant Caves of Aerilon (Aerilon - Perilous Cave System)",
  "description": "The Resonant Caves of Aerilon are a vast, bewildering labyrinth of interconnected caverns and tunnels bored deep within the shimmering, crystalline bone structure of the Sky-Titan Aerilon. These natural formations, augmented perhaps by ancient, unknown forces or the Titan's own growth, are lined with colossal, multifaceted crystals of extraordinary purity and size. These massive crystals possess unique resonant properties, causing them to amplify and bizarrely distort any sound or light that enters the caves. This creates a disorienting and perilous environment, rife with haunting echoes that mimic voices, phantasmal light shows that dance and shift to create bewildering illusions, and treacherous navigational hazards where paths seem to vanish or appear from nowhere. Deadly sonic traps can be triggered by unwary explorers, unleashing blasts of focused sound capable of shattering crystal or incapacitating living beings. The caves are not uninhabited; they serve as the domain of formidable crystalline guardians, animated by Aerilon's energies, and fiercely territorial flocks of giant sky-bats whose screeches become weapons in the echoing chambers. Deeper within this perilous maze, prospectors and sky-ship engineers brave the dangers in search of rich deposits of 'Aetherium,' rare, energy-focusing crystals vital for advanced sky-ship engines and other high-technology applications. The very air thrums with latent energy, and the constant interplay of light and sound makes the Resonant Caves a place of both breathtaking, alien beauty and extreme, ever-present danger.",
  "geography": {
    "region": "Within Aerilon's Crystalline Bone Structure, specifically in the deeper, less explored sections of its primary wing spars or core skeletal mass.",
    "landscape": "Labyrinthine cave system. Walls, ceilings, and floors lined with massive, naturally formed crystals. Features narrow tunnels, vast echoing chambers, crystal-choked fissures, underground rivers of condensed atmospheric moisture, and 'Silence Pockets' where sound is unnaturally dampened.",
    "climate": "Cool and stable, with a slight, constant breeze from Aerilon's movements or internal air currents. Air is often charged with static electricity. Light levels vary wildly from near-total darkness to dazzling reflections depending on crystal formations and external light sources brought in. Sound is a key environmental factor, highly amplified and distorted.",

    "legends": [
      "It's whispered that the largest crystals in the Grand Crystal Cathedral act as Aerilon's 'ears' or sensory organs, and that a sufficiently powerful sound or song performed there could directly influence the Titan's mood or even minor movements.",
      "Some believe the Crystalline Guardians are fragments of an ancient, precursor intelligence that once inhabited Aerilon, now bound to the crystals and programmed to protect its core structures.",
      "The Aetherium crystals are said to be 'crystallized sky-song' or 'condensed starlight' captured by Aerilon, holding memories or echoes of its celestial journeys.",
