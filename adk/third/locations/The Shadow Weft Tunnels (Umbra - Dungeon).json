  "name": "The Shadow Weft Tunnels (Umbra - Dungeon)",
  "description": "The Shadow Weft Tunnels are a bewildering, ever-shifting network of lightless passages and chambers existing beneath the alien surface of Umbra, the Shadowed Behemoth Titan. Within these oppressive depths, shadows themselves seem to possess tangible substance, coalescing into shifting walls, grasping tendrils, or deceptive pools of utter blackness. The tunnels writhe and reconfigure with an unsettling, silent intelligence, making maps useless and escape uncertain. They are fiercely guarded by predatory shadow beasts born from Umbra's essence, disorienting illusions that prey on the mind, and the very environment itself, which seeks to swallow light and sanity. Legends among Umbra's secretive denizens and daring off-Titan occultists whisper that these tunnels guard a potent artifact known as the 'Heart of Shadow,' or perhaps a fluctuating portal leading directly to a realm of pure, unadulterated darkness. Navigating the Shadow Weft Tunnels is a terrifying ordeal, requiring specialized, unwavering light sources, a rare innate attunement to the nature of shadow, or an iron will to resist the encroaching despair.",
  "geography": {
    "region": "Subterranean Umbra, beneath the Penumbral Veil.",
    "landscape": "A labyrinthine network of tunnels and caverns. Walls appear to be woven from solidified shadow, sometimes shimmering with faint, trapped bioluminescence or studded with light-absorbing crystals. Floors can shift from packed, cold earth to viscous, shadow-slick surfaces or bottomless pits of darkness. Passages may narrow or widen unpredictably, and entire sections can reconfigure over time or in response to intruders. Strange, shadow-based flora (e.g., 'Gloom Lichen,' 'Night-Whisper Weeds') clings to surfaces.",
    "climate": "Absolute lightlessness is the norm, broken only by faint, indigenous bioluminescence or explorers' own light sources, which are often suppressed or distorted. An unnatural, bone-chilling cold pervades the tunnels, and the air is heavy, still, and carries the scent of old dust and something akin to ozone or static. Disorienting auditory phenomena, such as whispers, faint cries, or the sound of slithering, are common, often originating from no discernible source. Umbra's stirs can cause the tunnels to violently compress, expand, or fill with tangible waves of shadow.",

      "The portal within the tunnels does not always lead to the same realm of darkness; its destination shifts with Umbra's moods or celestial alignments.",
      "Certain patterns of light and shadow, if correctly interpreted or created, can temporarily stabilize sections of the tunnels or reveal hidden passages.",

      "A 'Light-Eater Crystal': A shard of pulsating, dark crystal that can actively absorb nearby light sources, storing the energy for later, potentially dangerous release.",
      "The 'Codex of Shifting Paths': An illusory or magically protected tome that, if deciphered, might offer clues to predicting the tunnels' reconfigurations, though its contents may also induce madness.",
