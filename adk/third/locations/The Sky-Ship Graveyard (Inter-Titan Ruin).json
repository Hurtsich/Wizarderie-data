  "name": "The Sky-Ship Graveyard (Inter-Titan Ruin)",
  "description": "The Sky-Ship Graveyard is a vast, three-dimensional morass of shattered dreams and forgotten ambitions, a treacherous region of the upper atmosphere perpetually caught in the turbulent crosscurrents between major Titan migration routes. Over centuries, perhaps millennia, the wreckage of countless sky-ships from myriad eras and cultures has accumulated here, forming a chaotic, ever-shifting artificial debris field miles wide and deep. Hulks of ancient wooden galleons powered by primitive elemental bindings drift alongside the fractured remains of sleek, metal-alloyed cruisers and the enigmatic, crystalline wrecks of ships from unknown origins. Eerie lights flicker from damaged consoles, ethereal energies leak from ruptured power cores, and the groan of stressed metal and splintering wood forms a constant, mournful dirge. This celestial charnel house is haunted not only by sorrowful spirits of lost crews and vengeful air elementals but also by colossal Sky-Krakens that make their lairs within the largest conglomerations of debris, and by desperate, often violent, scavengers who risk their lives to pluck salvageable technology, lost cargo, and invaluable navigational charts from the metallic grasp of the fallen. Navigating the Graveyard is exceptionally dangerous, not just from its denizens, but from the constant threat of collision with tumbling debris, sudden decompressions, and exposure to hazardous materials leaking from breached hulls.",
  "geography": {
    "region": "The Turbulent Interstitial Skies / The Ghostwind Belt",
    "landscape": "A three-dimensional debris field composed of sky-ship wreckage. Key formations include: 'Hullglomerates' (massive islands of fused wreckage, some large enough to have developed micro-gravity or rudimentary, hazardous ecosystems); 'The Debris Maze' (dense fields of smaller, constantly shifting wreckage); 'The Ghost Fleet Passages' (areas dominated by older, eerily silent wrecks, often heavily patrolled by spirits); 'Rigging Tangles' (vast networks of snagged cables, ropes, and shattered masts forming web-like structures); and 'Open Graves' (relatively clearer pockets of space, often sites of recent collisions or Sky-Kraken feeding grounds).",
    "climate": "Extremely unpredictable and hazardous. Characterized by violent, erratic high-altitude winds, sudden pockets of calm that can trap unwary vessels, and localized electrical storms sparked by damaged technology or concentrated elemental activity. Temperatures fluctuate wildly based on altitude and proximity to active power sources or shadowed wreckage. Visibility is often poor due to particulate clouds of rust, ice crystals, and fine debris, or obscured by ethereal mists and glowing nebulae of leaked energy.",

      "The Chart-Corpse Cluster: A region known for a higher concentration of wrecks from early exploration eras, often sought for lost navigational data.",
      "Salvager's Rest: A surprisingly stable, hollowed-out battleship hull used as a temporary, clandestine outpost by various scavenger crews (though trust is a rare commodity).",
      "The Whispering Hulls: A section filled with ancient, barely intact ships where the voices of lost crews are said to echo constantly, driving many to madness.",
      "The 'Zero-Point' Anomaly: A mysterious area where gravity and other physical laws behave erratically, rumored to guard the most valuable, untouched wrecks."

  "demographics": {
    "population": "No permanent, civilized population. A transient and fluctuating number of scavengers, perhaps a few hundred at any given time, operating in small, independent crews.

  "government": {
    "type": "Complete Anarchy. The only 'law' is that of survival and strength. Scavenger crews operate independently, with internal hierarchies often based on the captain's ruthlessness and skill. Fleeting alliances are formed out of convenience and broken just as quickly.",

Dominance is localized and temporary, held by the most powerful scavenger captains (e.g., 'Wreck-Lord Kraya,' 'Iron-Grip Jax'), particularly large Sky-Krakens, or powerful elemental clusters. Territory is constantly contested through skirmishes, sabotage, and intimidation."
