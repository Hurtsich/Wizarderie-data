  "name": "The Sunken Temple of Azuria (Coralia - Ruin)",
  "description": "The Sunken Temple of Azuria is an awe-inspiring, ancient temple complex, now tragically beautiful in its partial submergence within 'Laguna Profunda,' one of Coralia's largest and deepest central lagoons. Millennia of Coralia's slow, inexorable growth have claimed much of this once-grand edifice, its ornate spires and sprawling courtyards now festooned with vibrant new coral growths and swaying kelp. Intricate, salt-etched carvings cover every remaining surface, depicting forgotten, tentacled sea deities in enigmatic communion with Coralia, and epic tales of a civilization that once thrived in harmony with the wandering atoll. The temple's waterlogged halls and crumbling chambers echo with the rush of strong currents and the unsettling silence of the deep. It is far from abandoned, however; ancient magical wards still pulse with faint energy, mutated aquatic guardians patrol its sunken corridors, and ingenious, water-logged traps protect its most sacred secrets. Legends whisper that the temple holds artifacts of immense power: relics that could allow limited communication with Coralia itself, or grant dominion over the teeming marine life of its lagoons.",
  "geography": {
    "region": "Laguna Profunda, Central Lagoon System, Coralia",
    "landscape": "A partially submerged ancient temple complex built from massive blocks of coral-infused stone and mother-of-pearl inlay. Features include flooded colonnades, crumbling plazas with remnants of statues, water-filled sacrificial chambers, hidden air pockets within upper spires, and treacherous underwater passages choked with debris and new coral growth. Bioluminescent algae and symbiotic marine organisms provide an eerie, shifting illumination in the deeper, lightless sections. The temple is constantly being reshaped by Coralia's growth and the lagoon's currents.",
    "climate": "The waters within and around the temple are warm and tropical, typical of Coralia's lagoons. However, inside the temple ruins, strong, unpredictable currents can form, creating whirlpools and dangerous surges, especially during Coralia's stirs. Visibility underwater varies greatly, from crystal clear in open, sunlit areas to murky and sediment-filled in enclosed chambers or during tidal shifts. Air pockets are humid and smell of brine and ancient stone.",

The artifacts it holds are rumored to be keys to understanding or even influencing the great Titan itself.",
