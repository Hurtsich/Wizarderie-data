  "name": "Umbra, the Shadowed Behemoth Titan",
  "description": "Umbra is an enigmatic Titan of immense, indeterminate shape, rarely glimpsed in its entirety as it is perpetually shrouded in an unnatural, self-generated twilight, dense, disorienting fog, or an oppressive, light-devouring shadow. Its back is an alien and bewildering landscape where normal physics often fray. Bioluminescent flora casts eerie, shifting glows upon plains of solidified shadow-stuff and forests of crystalline 'night-trees'. Bizarre, shadow-adapted fauna, often silent and possessing uncanny camouflage, hunt through valleys where light behaves in unpredictable and strange ways – bending, fragmenting, or vanishing entirely. Resources here are arcane and inherently dangerous, including shadow-infused crystals that pulse with dark energy, psychotropic plants that induce vivid hallucinations or grant glimpses into other realities, and nectars that can bestow shadow magic at a terrible cost. The cultures dwelling upon Umbra are invariably secretive and reclusive, often dealing in forbidden knowledge, potent shadow magic, or the trafficking of unique, dangerous Umbral resources. Umbra's movements are famously unpredictable and stealthy; it can appear from the mists without warning near other Titans, linger for a time, and then vanish just as silently, its passage often unmarked by conventional means. When Umbra stirs, it causes disorienting shifts in light and shadow across its back, temporary reality distortions, localized pockets of anti-magic, or even brief, terrifying incursions of shadow-stuff into the material world.",

    "landscape": "Forests of giant, bioluminescent fungi and crystalline 'Umbrage Trees' that absorb light; plains of 'Shadow-Slick' – a semi-solid, shifting dark substance; 'Mirror-Mist Valleys' filled with perpetual, light-distorting fog; 'Fractured Light Zones' where visibility is a chaotic kaleidoscope; areas of 'Tangible Twilight' where shadows have physical presence; deep, sound-dampening chasms; hidden enclaves built within massive, hollow shadow-crystals.",
    "climate": "Perpetual twilight or deep gloom, consistently cool and damp. Pockets of unnatural, bone-chilling cold are common, especially in areas where shadow is thickest. Dense, oily fogs can roll in suddenly, carrying disorienting whispers or phantasmal images. Light sources often behave erratically, their range diminished or their color altered. 'Shadowfalls' – cascades of pure, lightless energy – occur sporadically.",
