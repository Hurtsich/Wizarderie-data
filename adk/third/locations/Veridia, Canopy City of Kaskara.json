  "name": "Veridia, Canopy City of Kaskara",
  "description": "Veridia is a breathtaking, sprawling city ingeniously built within and among the colossal, millennia-old trees that form the upper canopy of Kaskara's Great Forest. Its structures are not merely built but woven from living wood, shaped by generations of skilled Veridian Woodshapers, resulting in an organic architecture that flows seamlessly with the giant trees. Homes, workshops, and civic buildings are nestled on massive branches, within hollowed trunks, or suspended on platforms woven from still-growing timber. These districts are interconnected by a complex network of sturdy, living vine bridges, gracefully arcing sky-bridges of polished wood, and swift 'branch-lifts' powered by clever counterweights or domesticated arboreal creatures. Bioluminescent fungi and flora are cultivated to provide a soft, ethereal glow during Kaskara's night cycles. Veridia is renowned throughout the Titans for its masterful woodcraft, the deep knowledge of its herbalists who cultivate rare canopy flora, its incredibly potent healing salves, and especially for the creation of exceptionally lightweight and durable sky-sails crafted from the giant, iridescent Sunleaves harvested from specific, sacred trees. Its inhabitants are skilled climbers and navigators of the vertical environment, living in deep harmony with Kaskara's forest, adapting with resilience to its slow, deliberate growth and the occasional, sometimes dramatic, limb shifts of the great Titan.",
  "geography": {
    "region": "The High Canopy of the Elderwood Forests, Kaskara",
    "landscape": "A multi-tiered urban environment built into the upper branches of a dense cluster of colossal, ancient trees. Features include massive, interconnected tree-platforms, interwoven living wood structures, suspended vine bridges, sky-walks, hanging gardens, and 'branch-roads'. The city is often above the lower mists of Kaskara's forests, offering spectacular views. Bioluminescent flora illuminates pathways and common areas.",
    "climate": "Temperate and humid, similar to Kaskara's general climate, but with unique microclimates within the canopy. Experiences dappled sunlight, gentle canopy breezes, and is often shrouded in morning mists rising from below. Less affected by ground-level tremors but highly sensitive to Kaskara's major limb movements and sways.",
