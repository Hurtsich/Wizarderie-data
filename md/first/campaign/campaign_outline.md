# Campaign Outline: The Veins of Aetherium

## I. Campaign Title: The Blight of Iron

## II. Core Premise & World Lore: The Veins of Aetherium

In this world, magic is not an ephemeral force, but a tangible essence woven into the very fabric of the earth's metals. It is called **Aetherium**, and it flows like a latent current through all ore veins, becoming concentrated within specific deposits. The act of smithing is therefore the act of channeling, shaping, and imbuing this Aetherium.

*   **The Nature of Metal-Magic (Metallurgy):** Magic is not "cast" in the traditional sense, but *forged*. Every enchantment is a meticulously crafted inscription, a specific tempering technique, or an alloy unique to its desired effect. Spells are less incantations and more complex metallurgical formulae. A "sorcerer" is a **Master Forger** or **Artificer**, capable of working raw Aetherium directly from ore or manipulating the infused metals of the world. Their "spellbook" is a tome of complex smithing schematics and alloy compositions.
*   **The Sundering:** Eons ago, the world was a primordial chaos of elemental forces. A cataclysmic event, known as **The Sundering**, shattered a celestial body made of pure Aetherium, embedding its fragments deep within the planet. This infusion fundamentally changed the world, binding magic to metal and giving rise to sentient life that instinctively understood this connection. Mythical tales speak of "Veins of the Cosmic Serpent" that run through the world's crust, pulsing with raw Aetherium.
*   **Societal Impact:**
    *   **Power & Economy:** Control over mines and master smiths is paramount. Nations rise and fall based on their access to rich ore veins and the expertise of their Forgemasters. The wealthiest individuals are often mining magnates or owners of grand forges.
    *   **Warfare:** Battlefields are dominated by enchanted weaponry and armor. War-golems and metallic constructs are common siege engines or elite shock troops. Mastering specific metals for warfare is a closely guarded secret.
    *   **Social Classes:** Master Forgers hold immense prestige, often serving as advisors, nobles, or even rulers. Miners are the backbone of society, often working in dangerous, grueling conditions but holding vital importance. Those with no connection to metal-magic (either through smithing or mining) are often considered lesser or dependent.
    *   **Religion:** Deities are often associated with fire, earth, metal, or creation. Temples might be built around active forges or sacred ore deposits.
*   **The Ore Hierarchy:** Different ores possess different magical properties, affecting the type and strength of enchantments they can hold.
    *   **Common Ores:** Iron, Copper, Tin (for basic tools, minor enhancements like sharpness or durability).
    *   **Rare Ores:** Silver (minor healing, purification), Gold (light, warmth, resistance to decay), Mithril (lightness, speed), Adamant (strength, protection). These are highly sought after.
    *   **Mythical Ores:** Star-Iron (manipulation of gravity, creation of localized null-zones), Ember-Stone (harnessing primal flame, creating lasting heat), Quicksilver (fluidity, shapeshifting effects), Whisper-Steel (mental manipulation, telepathy). These are exceedingly rare, found only in the deepest, most dangerous veins.
    *   **Legendary Ores:** The **Heart-Ore** (or **Primordial Vein**), believed to be a fragment of the original Aetherium. Unlocking its secrets is the ultimate goal of many powerful factions. Its properties are said to be limitless or capable of fundamentally altering reality.
*   **Ancient Forges/Relics:** Rumors persist of ancient, forgotten forges powered by geothermal vents or even captured elementals, where the secrets of manipulating mythical ores were once commonplace. Relics from these eras, often seamless alloys of multiple mythical metals, are incredibly powerful and incredibly rare.

## III. Key Factions & Powers

1.  **The Forgewrought Hegemony:**
    *   **Description:** The dominant human empire, built upon centuries of masterful smithing and strategic control of common and rare ore veins. Their capital, **Ignisburg**, is a colossal forge-city, constantly alight with the glow of thousands of forges. They believe Aetherium is a gift to be harnessed and controlled for the good of civilization (their civilization, specifically).
    *   **Goals:** Expand control over all known ore veins, perfect new forging techniques, maintain technological and magical superiority. They seek to absorb or subjugate other factions.
    *   **Strengths:** Vast armies of armored smith-soldiers, highly efficient production of enchanted goods, renowned Master Forgers, and powerful metallic war-constructs.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Bureaucratic, prone to internal power struggles between rival forge-families, arrogant, and slow to adapt to truly novel threats. Their reliance on specific ore veins makes them vulnerable if those veins fail.

2.  **The Deep-Dwellers (The Crystalline Collective):**
    *   **Description:** A subterranean society, primarily composed of a stout, industrious race resembling Dwarves, who are the true masters of mining and deep-earth knowledge. They view Aetherium as a sacred, living essence of the world, to be respected and only taken with reverence. Their capital, **Kael’Thar**, is a labyrinthine city carved from crystalline rock, pulsing with the subtle magic of unworked Aetherium.
    *   **Goals:** Protect the sacred deep veins from surface dwellers, preserve ancient knowledge of Aetherium's true nature, maintain their cultural purity. They seek to understand the very "heartbeat" of the world's magic.
    *   **Strengths:** Unparalleled mining expertise, knowledge of complex underground systems, unique methods of interacting with raw Aetherium, powerful earth-infused constructs, and hardy warriors.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Isolationist, deeply mistrustful of outsiders, slow to engage in surface politics, and their rituals for accessing Aetherium can be slow and demanding.

3.  **The Aetherium Alchemists (The Obsidian Conclave):**
    *   **Description:** A secretive, often amoral, order of scholars, engineers, and radical smiths who view Aetherium as a purely scientific phenomenon to be dissected, understood, and ultimately replicated or synthesized. They operate from hidden laboratories and academies, often in neutral territories or beneath the notice of the Hegemony.
    *   **Goals:** Unravel the fundamental laws of Aetherium, synthesize new metallic compounds, create artificial veins, and push the boundaries of metal-magic beyond traditional forging methods, even if it means dangerous experimentation.
    *   **Strengths:** Cutting-edge research, unique (and sometimes dangerous) experimental alloys, creation of wondrous and terrifying metallic abominations, mastery of elemental transmutation.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Ethical blind spots, prone to reckless experimentation, internal rivalries for groundbreaking discoveries, and a tendency to prioritize knowledge over life. They are few in number and often need external resources.

4.  **The Scavenger Clans (The Iron Nomads):**
    *   **Description:** Independent groups of prospectors, rogue smiths, and hardened survivors who traverse the dangerous wilds and blighted lands, seeking untamed ore veins, lost relics, and forgotten forges. They are self-reliant and live outside the established powers, often clashing with all factions.
    *   **Goals:** Survival, accumulating wealth through independent finds, preserving their freedom from the Hegemony's control, finding legendary "ghost veins" that disappear as quickly as they appear.
    *   **Strengths:** Resilient, adaptable, masters of wilderness survival, resourceful, possess unique knowledge of forgotten paths and dangerous territories.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of centralized power, prone to internal feuds, limited resources, and often viewed as bandits or outcasts by established powers.

5.  **The Rust Cults (The Iron Blight):**
    *   **Description:** A terrifying, decentralized network of individuals and groups afflicted by a strange corruption of Aetherium, often called "The Rust." They believe the world's metal is sick and must be "purified" through a process of decay and deconstruction. They are often disfigured by metallic growths and wield weapons that spread corrosion.
    *   **Goals:** To spread the Blight, to dismantle the "false" order built on "impurified" Aetherium, and to ultimately return all metal to a primal, decaying state, believing this is the only way for new, "true" Aetherium to emerge.
    *   **Strengths:** Fanatical devotion, immunity to certain forms of metallic magic, ability to corrupt and control diseased metal, wield disturbing and potent "Rust Magic."
    *   **Weaknesses:** Disorganized (though united in purpose), hated by all other factions, susceptible to purification magic, and their bodies and minds are slowly consumed by the very power they wield.

## IV. Significant Locations

1.  **Ignisburg, The Forgewrought Citadel:** The beating heart of the Hegemony. A colossal city of tiered forges, sky-spanning metallic bridges, and armories. Smoke plumes constantly fill the sky. The **Grand Forge Prime**, where the Hegemony's most powerful artifacts are crafted, lies at its core. Beneath it lie vast vaults of mined ore and ancient schematics.
2.  **The Whispering Mines:** An ancient, vast mining complex deep within the contested **Fractured Peaks**. Legend says it delves into a direct tributary of the Cosmic Serpent's Vein. It is claimed by the Hegemony, but constantly contested by the Deep-Dwellers and rumored to be infested with strange, shimmering metallic aberrations.
3.  **Kael’Thar, The Crystal Heart:** The Deep-Dwellers' capital. A breathtaking subterranean city carved from giant geodes and veins of pure, unworked crystal. Its architecture is naturally grown and sculpted rather than built, reflecting the Deep-Dwellers' reverence for the earth. Contains the **Prime Resonator**, a massive Aetherium crystal that hums with the pulse of the world's magic.
4.  **The Crucible Peaks:** A jagged, volcanic mountain range rich in unexploited, often unstable, ore veins. Home to both Deep-Dweller outposts and daring Scavenger Clans. The air shimmers with latent magical energies, and elemental metal creatures are common.
5.  **The Rustlands/Ash Wastes:** A desolate, perpetually decaying region. Once fertile, it was consumed by a catastrophic metallic blight centuries ago, leaving behind rusted husks of cities, barren land, and lakes of corrosive runoff. The primary base of operations for the Rust Cults. Strange, self-replicating metallic tumors dot the landscape.
6.  **The Grand Metallurgic Academy (Hidden Forge):** A clandestine research facility belonging to the Obsidian Conclave. Its location is a closely guarded secret, rumored to be in a pocket dimension, a hidden mountain valley, or deep beneath an inert volcano. Here, the Conclave performs their most dangerous and unethical experiments on Aetherium.
7.  **The Sunken Forge (Mythical Site):** An ancient forge, said to predate The Sundering, submerged beneath a desolate sea or buried deep underground. Legends claim it was powered by a captured element or was capable of forging a "Heart-Ore" directly. Its discovery would be a monumental event.

## V. Important Characters (NPCs)

1.  **Grand Master Ferrum (Hegemony):** The ancient, revered leader of the Forgemasters Council in Ignisburg. His body is almost entirely replaced with enchanted adamantium, a testament to his skill and age. He is pragmatic, stern, and deeply devoted to the Hegemony's strength. He senses a coming doom.
2.  **Arch-Metallurgist Kael (Obsidian Conclave):** A brilliant but ruthless scholar from the Obsidian Conclave. Obsessed with synthesizing Aetherium, he disregards ethics and often pushes his experiments to destructive ends. He may be secretly trying to weaponize the "Blight" or find a way to control it.
3.  **Dread-King Thorgrim Stonehand (Deep-Dwellers):** The stoic and distrustful leader of the Crystalline Collective. He views surface dwellers as arrogant despoilers of the earth. He is fiercely protective of his people and the sacred Aetherium veins, but recent tremors and odd occurrences beneath the earth force him to consider unprecedented alliances.
4.  **The Rust Prophet (Rust Cults):** A charismatic and terrifying figure, believed to be the living embodiment of the Blight itself. Their body is a shifting mass of corroded metal and flesh. They preach the "purification" of the world through decay, twisting the Aetherium into a destructive force. Their true identity is unknown, perhaps a former revered Forgemaster.
5.  **Lady Ember Forgeheart (Hegemony/Rogue):** A young, prodigiously talented Master Smith from the Hegemony, known for her innovative (and sometimes unconventional) forging methods. She is empathetic and concerned about the growing instability, potentially breaking from Hegemony doctrine to find true solutions. She could be an ally or a rival.
6.  **The Silent Prospector (Scavenger Clans):** A reclusive, heavily armored figure who wanders the wilds, claiming to have found veins of "singing" or "weeping" ore. They possess intimate knowledge of hidden paths and ancient, forgotten sites. They communicate largely through gestures or short, cryptic sentences. They might have a personal vendetta against the Rust Cults or a secret connection to the Blight.

## VI. The Campaign Arc: The Blight of Iron

The campaign revolves around a mysterious, creeping corruption affecting the world's metal-magic: **The Blight of Iron**. This blight causes enchanted metals to fail, raw ore veins to corrode, and living beings exposed to it to slowly transform into twisted, metallic abominations.

### Inciting Incident: The Dying Spark

*   The PCs, perhaps apprentices, prospectors, or mercenaries, are in a smaller, isolated forge-town or mining settlement.
*   The first signs of the Blight appear: a revered master smith's prized hammer suddenly rusts and shatters, enchanted tools fail sporadically, or a newly discovered ore vein is found completely corroded and useless.
*   A frantic plea for help comes from a nearby mine where workers are falling ill with strange metallic growths, and the ore itself seems to be "bleeding" rust.
*   This local anomaly causes fear and suspicion, leading to initial local conflicts (e.g., Hegemony troops enforcing quarantines, Deep-Dwellers closing their borders, Scavenger Clans trying to exploit the chaos).

### Act I: The Spreading Rust & Local Conflicts (Levels 1-5)

*   **Initial Investigations:** PCs are hired to investigate the strange occurrences. They uncover initial evidence of the Blight – not just rust, but a fundamental unraveling of the Aetherium bond within the metal.
*   **Localized Outbreaks:** More villages or mines report similar issues. The Blight spreads, causing economic disruption and panic. Local smiths are at a loss, and remedies fail.
*   **First Encounters:** PCs encounter "Rust Thralls" – creatures or humanoids partially or wholly transformed by the Blight. They might also find agents of the Rust Cults spreading the corruption or performing dark rituals.
*   **Factional Tensions:** The Hegemony sends enforcers, Deep-Dwellers seal off entrances, and Scavengers become more aggressive in their search for unaffected veins. PCs get caught in the middle, perhaps hired by one faction, only to discover another holds crucial information.
*   **Quest Examples:**
    *   **The Unraveling Tool:** Retrieve a specific, highly enchanted artifact that has become corrupted, hoping its unique composition reveals something.
    *   **Cleansing the Vein:** Venture into a blighted mine to clear it of Rust Thralls and determine if the vein can be salvaged.
    *   **The Prospector's Plea:** Rescue a trapped or abducted prospector who claims to have witnessed a "pulse of rust" from deep underground.
    *   **Tracking the Cult:** Follow the trail of the Rust Cults to a blighted forest or abandoned forge, uncovering their basic beliefs and methods.

### Act II: Unraveling the Mystery & Faction Politics (Levels 6-12)

*   **Escalation:** The Blight intensifies, affecting larger regions and more potent magical items. Prominent Forgemasters fall ill, and fear grips the land. The Hegemony's power is challenged.
*   **Seeking Knowledge:** The PCs must seek higher knowledge.
    *   **Hegemony Arc:** Travel to Ignisburg to consult with Grand Master Ferrum, navigating the political intrigues of the Forgemasters Council. They might be tasked with securing a vital, uncorrupted mythical ore.
    *   **Deep-Dweller Arc:** Venture into the perilous Crucible Peaks to seek answers from Dread-King Thorgrim Stonehand or the Crystalline Collective, proving their worth and intentions. They might learn of ancient prophecies or warnings about the "Vein's Sickness."
    *   **Obsidian Conclave Arc:** Track down a hidden laboratory of the Aetherium Alchemists (Arch-Metallurgist Kael), potentially offering a cure or a dangerous experimental solution, or trying to prevent them from unleashing something worse.
*   **The Blight's True Nature:** Through these investigations, the PCs discover the Blight is not just a disease but an active, malicious force. It's revealed to be:
    *   **Option A (Ancient Malice):** An ancient, primordial elemental of decay and entropy, imprisoned long ago and now stirring.
    *   **Option B (Failed Creation):** A catastrophic failure of an ancient mega-forge or a powerful Aetherium conduit, causing a cascade reaction.
    *   **Option C (Primordial Consumption):** An entity that directly consumes Aetherium, causing metal to "starve" and decay.
*   **Factional Crossroads:** PCs are forced to make difficult choices, forging alliances between reluctant factions (e.g., Hegemony and Deep-Dwellers) or choosing sides. Trust is paramount.
*   **Quest Examples:**
    *   **The Heart of the Crystal:** Descend into Kael'Thar to help the Deep-Dwellers purify a section of the Prime Resonator, learning ancient Aetherium rituals.
    *   **Schematics of Disaster:** Infiltrate an Obsidian Conclave laboratory to retrieve experimental data or sabotage a dangerous prototype that could worsen the Blight.
    *   **The Ironclad Legion:** Help a Hegemony general secure a strategic fort from a massive Blight-corrupted metallic construct, powered by a twisted core.
    *   **Tracking the Prophet:** Pursue the Rust Prophet into the Ash Wastes, battling their elite Blight-ridden followers and learning more about their dark power.

### Act III: Confronting the Source & Saving the Veins (Levels 13-20)

*   **Cataclysmic Threat:** The Blight reaches its apex, threatening to sever the world's connection to Aetherium entirely. Entire cities are on the verge of collapsing into rust, and all enchanted items flicker and fail.
*   **Identifying the Epicenter:** The PCs, through their combined knowledge and clues, pinpoint the true source of the Blight:
    *   Could be the **Sunken Forge**, twisted into a conduit for decay.
    *   Could be a newly revealed **Primordial Vein** deep beneath the earth, being actively corrupted.
    *   Could be a dimensional tear created by a reckless experiment that pulls in an anti-Aetherium force.
*   **Gathering Allies & Resources:** The PCs must rally what remains of the Hegemony, Deep-Dwellers, and even remnants of the Scavenger Clans or morally sound Alchemists. They must secure a legendary artifact, a specific alloy, or master a forgotten forging technique that can counteract the Blight.
*   **The Final Push:** An epic journey into the heart of the Blight's source. This involves traversing corrupted landscapes, battling increasingly powerful metallic abominations, and navigating the maddening effects of the corrupted Aetherium.
*   **Climax:** Confrontation with the ultimate cause of the Blight – be it a primordial entity, a rogue metallic god, or the final iteration of the Rust Prophet infused with overwhelming dark Aetherium. This climactic battle will test their skill, knowledge, and alliances.
*   **Resolution:**
    *   **Purification:** The Blight is cleansed, but the world is forever changed. Aetherium is more fragile, requiring greater care, or perhaps a new, more balanced relationship between factions is forged.
    *   **Containment:** The Blight cannot be fully destroyed but is contained, requiring constant vigilance and a new class of "Wardens of the Veins."
    *   **Sacrifice/Rebirth:** A great sacrifice is made, perhaps a legendary forge is destroyed or a Master Forger gives their life, to allow Aetherium to be reborn in a new form, leaving the world with a different, perhaps more mysterious, magical landscape.
*   **Quest Examples:**
    *   **Forging the Anti-Relic:** Guide allied smiths in forging a powerful artifact from a legendary ore, requiring epic components and rare knowledge.
    *   **Siege of the Sunken Forge:** Lead an allied army to reclaim or assault the Blight's core, battling through layers of corrupted metal and animated constructs.
    *   **The Prophet's Last Stand:** Confront the Rust Prophet and their inner circle, battling not only them but the encroaching Blight within the very battlefield.
    *   **The Vein's Heartbeat:** A final ritual, potentially requiring a PC's or NPC's direct interaction with the world's core Aetherium, to stabilize or cleanse it, risking absorption or transformation.

## VII. Hooks & Side Quests

*   **The Missing Schematics:** A valuable set of ancient forging schematics has been stolen from a Master Smith, rumored to be in the hands of a Scavenger Clan.
*   **Elemental Infusion:** A prospector found a raw ore vein that seems to have trapped a living elemental, causing unpredictable magical surges. Recovering or freeing it.
*   **The Rust Curse:** An antique, powerful metallic artifact recovered from a ruin slowly begins to corrupt its wielder, turning their skin to rust or their thoughts to decay.
*   **War-Golem Gone Rogue:** A powerful, Hegemony-designed war-golem has malfunctioned and is rampaging through a rural area, requiring a specialized smith to disable it.
*   **The Singing Ore:** Rumors of a unique ore vein that hums with strange melodies, said to grant prophetic visions or terrible madness.
*   **The Alchemist's Apprentice:** An apprentice of the Obsidian Conclave escapes with a dangerous, unstable alloy, seeking help to dispose of it before it causes a localized Blight.
*   **Deep-Dweller Diplomacy:** A Deep-Dweller outpost is under siege by surface dwellers, requiring the PCs to negotiate a fragile truce or repel the attackers.

## VIII. Magic & Technology Implications

*   **Casting Spells:** "Spellcasting" involves wielding a carefully crafted metallic tool (a "Forging Focus" or "Resonance Rod") and performing intricate motions that resonate with the Aetherium. Specific alloys and temperatures might be required for different "spells." A "Fireball" might be a highly volatile alloy ignited by specific strikes, a "Shield" a rapidly forming metallic barrier from refined dust.
*   **Enchanting:** This is the primary form of magic. It is a grueling, precise smithing process requiring specific heat, hammering techniques, and the correct blend of metals. A weapon's enchantment isn't just cast upon it, it *is* the weapon's very metallurgical composition.
*   **Healing:** Specialized "Chirurgical Alloys" can be forged into needles or plates that accelerate healing, mend broken bones, or purify diseased flesh. These are often made from silver-infused metals.
*   **Constructs:** Golems, animated armor, clockwork creations, and automated defenses are common and powered by internal Aetherium cores or integrated metallic components. They are a staple of Hegemony warfare.
*   **Currency:** While common coins exist, the true wealth is measured in unworked, pure Aetherium ore or small, highly refined ingots of rare and mythical metals.
*   **Warfare:** Dominated by heavily enchanted plate armor, self-repairing weapons, projectile launchers that fire magically-charged bolts, and mighty metallic war-engines capable of unleashing elemental attacks.

## IX. Potential Player Character Hooks

*   **The Disgraced Apprentice:** An apprentice smith whose master was unjustly blamed for the first signs of the Blight, seeking to clear their name and find the truth.
*   **The Rogue Prospector:** A seasoned independent prospector who stumbled upon a strange, unlisted ore vein that resonates with a disturbing energy, pulling them into the growing crisis.
*   **The Hegemony Deserter:** A former soldier or engineer of the Forgewrought Hegemony, disillusioned by its rigid dogmas and seeking a more ethical path to combat the Blight.
*   **The Deep-Dweller Exile:** A Deep-Dweller who left their insular society to understand the surface world's Aetherium, now seeing their worst fears confirmed by the spreading Blight.
*   **The Aetherium Experiment:** A former subject or junior researcher of the Obsidian Conclave, who gained unique (and potentially dangerous) insights or abilities from an experiment gone wrong.
*   **The Child of the Rustlands:** Born in a blighted zone, possessing a strange immunity or connection to the corrupted Aetherium, seeking a way to reclaim their homeland.
