## Location: Anvil's Rest

**Region:** (Assumed to be in a region near early Blight manifestations, possibly close to mines or forests where initial signs are appearing, as per Act I of "The Blight of Iron" campaign outline).

**Type:** Village (Smithing Focus)

**Description:**
Anvil's Rest has always been a beacon of simple industry and reliable craftsmanship. Nestled in a valley blessed with decent, if not extraordinary, iron deposits and surrounded by dense woodlands providing ample charcoal, the village has thrived for generations. Its heart is the rhythmic clang of hammers on anvils, the cheerful glow of forges, and the scent of hot metal and quenching steam. The villagers are known for their sturdy tools, dependable ploughshares, and the occasional, surprisingly well-crafted weapon or piece of armor, though they are a peaceful folk by nature. Family lines are traced through master-apprentice smithing traditions, and the community prides itself on honesty, hard work, and the quality of their steel.

Lately, however, a palpable shadow has fallen over Anvil's Rest. Whispers of "The Blight of Iron" that started in distant mines and foreign cities have become fearful murmurs here. Tools that once held their edge for years now show unnatural spots of aggressive rust overnight. Prized anvils, some passed down for generations, have developed weeping, metallic sores. The comforting rhythm of the forges is now often punctuated by worried discussions and the unsettling silence of a smith staring in disbelief at a ruined piece of work. The air of camaraderie is strained, replaced by suspicion and a growing dread of what this creeping decay means for their livelihoods, their heritage, and their lives.

**Features:**

*   **The Stone Hearth Inn:** The traditional social hub, run by the jovial (though now perpetually worried) Elara Redman. Usually bustling, itâ€™s now quieter, with patrons speaking in hushed tones about the strange occurrences. The inn's sign, a beautifully wrought iron anvil, has recently developed a disquieting orange sheen.
*   **The Communal Forge:** A large, open-air but roofed structure with multiple hearths and anvils. Once the heart of the village's production, many hearths now lie cold. Those still in use are tended by nervous smiths who meticulously inspect every piece of metal.
*   **Elder Borin's Workshop:** (Referencing the "Unraveling Tool" quest) The workshop of Borin Stonehand, a respected elder smith. It now stands as a grim testament to the Blight's arrival, its tools corrupted, and an unnatural silence clinging to it. It's a place villagers now avoid, pointing to it as the first place in Anvil's Rest truly touched by the Blight.
*   **The Rusty Creek:** A small creek that runs by the village, used for quenching. Recently, villagers have noticed an oily, rust-colored sheen on its surface in places, and the metal culverts and grates along its banks are rapidly decaying.
*   **The Ironwood Copse:** A small, managed woodland nearby that provides the charcoal for the forges. Loggers have reported trees with bark that feels strangely metallic to the touch and patches of unusual, hardened sap that flakes off like rusty scales.

**Key NPCs:**

*   **Master Smith Kaelen:** The current de-facto leader of the village's smiths, a strong, capable woman in her late 40s. She is trying to maintain morale and find a practical solution, but is increasingly frustrated and scared by the Blight's inexplicable nature. She might be skeptical of magical explanations initially, preferring to believe it's a new type_of ore contamination.
*   **Old Man Hemlock:** The village eccentric and herb-gatherer. He claims the Blight is "the anger of the earth" and mutters about ancient warnings and disturbances in the natural order. Most dismiss him, but some are starting to listen.
*   **Young Lyra:** A smith's apprentice, observant and curious. She might have noticed subtle, early signs of the Blight that others missed, or she may have seen strange creatures or individuals (Rust Cultists?) near the Ironwood Copse or the Rusty Creek.

**Potential Lore & Motivations for Players:**

*   **A Cry for Help:** The villagers, especially Kaelen, might pool their resources to hire outsiders (the players) to investigate the source of the Blight affecting their village, hoping their expertise or detachment can find answers the locals cannot.
*   **Protecting a Legacy:** If a player has a background as a smith or has ties to craftsmanship, the plight of Anvil's Rest will resonate deeply. They might be motivated to save this unique community and its traditions.
*   **The First Domino:** Anvil's Rest could be one of the first "ordinary" settlements to be significantly impacted, making it a crucial place to study the Blight's early effects on a community that *is* metal. Its fate could be a grim foreshadowing for larger towns and cities.
*   **Seeds of the Cult:** The subtle corruption in the Ironwood Copse or the Rusty Creek could be the work of early-stage Rust Cultists, using Anvil's Rest as an unwitting test site or a place to gather corrupted materials. Players might uncover their hidden activities.
*   **Borin's Legacy:** Following the events of "The Unraveling Tool," the players might return to Anvil's Rest to find the Blight worsening, feeling a responsibility to help the community that Borin was a part of. The Star-Metal Krys, if retrieved, might react strangely to the Blight's increased presence here.

**Player Options:**

*   **Investigation:** Players can examine the corrupted tools, the Rusty Creek, and the Ironwood Copse, looking for patterns, the origin of the contamination, or any unusual substances.
*   **Defense:** As fear grows, some villagers might look to the players for protection against potential Blight-spawned creatures if the corruption worsens (e.g., if animals from the Ironwood Copse become blighted).
*   **Research & Experimentation:** If any smiths are still willing, players could try to work with them to see how the Blight affects different metals or forging processes, perhaps trying to create a resistant alloy (tying into the "Whispering Forge" easter egg's lore).
*   **Moral Dilemmas:** If the Blight worsens, decisions about quarantining affected areas, destroying corrupted (but sentimentally valuable) items, or even dealing with villagers showing early signs of transformation could arise.
