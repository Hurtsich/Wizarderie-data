## Location: The Blighted Grove

**Region:** Ironwood Forest (as established in "Anvil's Rest" and "Tracking the Cultists")

**Type:** Corrupted Forest Grove / Potential Cultist Hideout

**Description:**
Once, this grove might have been a testament to the Ironwood's unique nature, a place where the metallic sheen of the trees was particularly vibrant. Now, it is a festering wound within the forest. The "Blight of Iron" has warped the grove into a grotesque parody of its former state. Trees with bark like rusted iron stand twisted into unnatural shapes, their metallic leaves flaking and crumbling into corrosive dust. A sickly, rust-colored sap weeps from cracks in their trunks, pooling on the ground in viscous, oily puddles. The air is heavy with the tang of decay and a faint, unsettling hum that seems to vibrate in your teeth. The undergrowth is sparse, consisting mainly of brittle, blackened weeds that crunch underfoot. An eerie silence hangs over the grove, broken only by the occasional drip of rusty sap or the skittering of unseen things.

**Features:**

*   **The Weeping Arch:** The entrance to the grove is marked by two large Ironwood trees that have bent and fused together, forming a decaying archway. Rust-colored sap constantly drips from this arch, making the ground beneath slick and treacherous. The "weeping gear" symbol of the Rust Cult is crudely carved into the arch.
*   **Corrupted Ironwood Trees:** The trees within the grove are visibly blighted. Their bark is pitted and crumbling, revealing inner layers that look like diseased flesh mixed with metal. Touching them leaves a rusty residue on the skin and a faint, unpleasant warmth. Some trees have metallic "growths" or "tumors" protruding from them.
*   **Rust Pools:** Several depressions in the ground have filled with the weeping sap, forming stagnant pools of rust-colored liquid. These pools sometimes bubble faintly, and the ground around them is heavily corroded. They may be hazardous.
*   **The Central Clearing:** Deeper within the grove is a small, unnatural clearing. The ground here is bare and packed hard, stained dark. This is the most likely place for Rust Cult activity. There might be a crude altar made of rusted scrap metal, discarded tools showing signs of Blight, or remnants of dark rituals.
*   **Blighted Wildlife:** Any wildlife that wanders into the grove (or is deliberately kept here) is likely corrupted by the Blight. Expect creatures with metallic growths, aggressive temperaments, and perhaps abilities that spread the Blight (e.g., a bite that causes creeping rust on metal armor).
*   **Hidden Cache:** The Rust Cultists might have a small, hidden cache of supplies or disturbing relics buried or concealed within one of the more grotesquely twisted trees. This could contain notes, corrupted Aetherium fragments, or tools used in their rituals.

**Key NPCs (Potential):**

*   **Rust Cult Sentries:** If the grove is an active hideout, expect zealous cultists guarding the perimeter or lurking within. They would be armed with rust-infected weapons.
*   **Blighted Nature Warden (Mini-Boss):** A once-proud guardian of the Ironwood (perhaps a treant or a powerful beast) now utterly corrupted by the Blight, serving as an unwitting protector of the cult's activities.
*   **Verdigris (Mention or Glimpse):** If this is a significant meeting spot, players might find evidence of the Rust-Priest Verdigris's presence (as mentioned in "Tracking the Cultists"), such as written orders, a discarded personal item, or even catch a fleeting glimpse of him if they are exceptionally stealthy or unlucky.

**Lore & Motivations for Players:**

*   **Tracking the Source:** As per the "Tracking the Cultists" quest, players may be led here following the "weeping gear" symbol, seeking the Rust Cult's hideout and intelligence about their plans or their leader, Verdigris.
*   **Containing the Spread:** The Blight emanating from this grove might be affecting the surrounding Ironwood Forest or nearby water sources. Players might be tasked with cleansing the grove or finding a way to stop the corruption from spreading further.
*   **Rescue Mission:** The Rust Cult could be holding prisoners within the grove â€“ perhaps captured villagers, wayward travelers, or even members of another faction.
*   **Understanding the Blight:** The intense concentration of Blight here could offer clues to its nature. Are the trees themselves being "converted" into something else? Is there a focal point of the corruption within the grove?
*   **A Place of Power:** The Rust Cult may have chosen this grove because the unique metallic nature of the Ironwood trees interacts powerfully with the Blight, allowing them to conduct specific rituals or empower their corrupted Aetherium.

**Player Options:**

*   **Stealth and Observation:** Attempt to infiltrate the grove, observe cultist activities, and gather intelligence without alerting them (aligns with the "Tracking the Cultists" quest objectives).
*   **Direct Assault:** If stealth fails or is not the objective, players might engage the cultists and any blighted creatures directly to clear out the grove.
*   **Environmental Interaction:** Can the rust pools be ignited or neutralized? Can the corrupted trees be toppled to create barriers or distractions? Is it possible to collect samples of the blighted sap or metallic leaves for study?
*   **Ritual Disruption:** If the cultists are in the midst of a ritual, players might have an opportunity to disrupt it, potentially with explosive or unpredictable consequences.
*   **Seeking a Cure (Long-term):** If players are focused on understanding and combating the Blight, this grove could be a key location for gathering samples or observing the Blight's effects on a unique ecosystem.
