## Location: Coppertown

**Region:** Bordering mountain ranges, historically rich in copper, now adjacent to areas showing early signs of the Blight of Iron.

**Type:** Mining Town

**Description:**
Coppertown is a hardy, bustling settlement clinging to the rocky slopes of the Dragon's Tooth Mountains. For generations, its lifeblood has been the rich veins of copper that thread through the peaks, giving the town its name and its distinctive reddish-brown hue from the dust that settles on everything. The architecture is functional and sturdy, built from mountain stone and timber, designed to withstand harsh winters and the occasional tremor from the mining activities deep below. The town is known for its resilient, plain-spoken populace â€“ miners, smiths specializing in copper and bronze, merchants who trade the valuable ore, and the families who support them. The air usually rings with the distant echo of pickaxes, the rumble of ore carts, and the hiss of smelters.

However, the news from the lowlands and other mining communities about "The Blight of Iron" has cast a long shadow over Coppertown. While their primary resource, copper, seems *so far* unaffected by the rust and decay plaguing iron and steel, a deep sense of unease has settled. Scouts and traders returning from afar speak of failing iron tools, corrupted machinery, and even horrific transformations. The townsfolk are wary, their inherent toughness now tinged with fear. They've begun to eye iron tools with suspicion, and the usually boisterous taverns are filled with anxious speculation. The town's leadership is caught between maintaining calm and preparing for a threat they don't fully understand, a threat that could cripple the world they know, even if it doesn't directly consume their precious copper.

**Features:**

*   **The Copperhead Mine:** The largest and oldest mine in the area, its entrance a yawning maw at the base of the mountain. The mine shafts delve deep, and while the copper flows, miners are increasingly nervous about the integrity of their iron tools and the winch mechanisms.
*   **The Bronze Kettle Inn:** The main gathering place, run by a retired mine foreman named "Grizzled" Martha. The inn is famous for its potent cider and hearty stews. Conversations here are dominated by Blight news and local mining gossip.
*   **The Assay Office & Exchange:** Where copper ore is weighed, valued, and traded. Headed by the meticulous and increasingly stressed Guildmaster Borin Copperhand (no direct relation to Borin Stonehand of Anvil's Rest, but a common name in mining regions). He's worried about the economic impact if trade routes become unsafe or if demand for copper plummets due to failing iron-based infrastructure elsewhere.
*   **Lookout Point:** A high bluff overlooking the town and the surrounding mountain passes. It's usually manned by a single watchman, but patrols have been doubled, more to spot any signs of Blight-corrupted refugees or creatures than invaders.
*   **The Smelters District:** A series of large, stone smelters that process the raw copper ore. The air here is thick with heat and metallic fumes. Workers have reported iron grates and tools around the smelters showing unusual, rapid corrosion, though the copper itself remains pure. This is a significant point of concern.

**Key NPCs:**

*   **Mayor Thora Ironpicket:** A pragmatic and strong leader, descended from a long line of mine overseers. She's trying to balance the need for continued production with the safety of her people, and is secretly trying to acquire more information about the Blight.
*   **Chief Miner Grimgar Stonebeard:** A grizzled dwarf who has seen it all, or so he thought. He's skeptical of "lowlander panic" but is privately worried by the reports and the strange behavior of iron tools in the deeper sections of the Copperhead Mine.
*   **Lyra Swiftarrow:** A young, sharp-eyed scout and hunter who ranges far from Coppertown. She was one of the first to bring back detailed accounts of Blight-affected areas, and her warnings are starting to be taken more seriously. She might have seen more than she's letting on.
*   **Anya "Sparks" Volkov:** A talented but eccentric smith who specializes in bronze alloys. She's been experimenting with creating tools and even small mechanical constructs that use minimal or no iron, driven by a premonition of disaster.

**Potential Lore & Motivations for Players:**

*   **A Haven or a Target?:** Coppertown, with its seemingly Blight-immune primary resource, might be seen by outsiders as a potential safe haven, leading to an influx of refugees. Alternatively, if the Blight shows an ability to corrupt other metals or if its minions attack, the town could become a target.
*   **The Miner's Plight (Copper Variation):** The "Miner's Plight" player hook from the Blight of Iron campaign could be adapted. Perhaps subtle signs of the Blight *are* starting to affect the deeper, less-pure copper veins, or the machinery used to extract it is failing, threatening the town's livelihood.
*   **Search for Resistant Materials:** Given their expertise with copper and bronze, the smiths of Coppertown (especially Anya "Sparks") might be crucial in researching or developing Blight-resistant alloys, tying into "The Whispering Forge" easter egg. Players might be sent here to seek their aid or to protect their knowledge.
*   **Economic Collapse:** If the Blight destroys iron-based economies, the demand for copper (for bronze, electrical wiring if applicable, etc.) might skyrocket, making Coppertown suddenly strategically vital, or it might crash if the infrastructure to use copper also fails.
*   **Early Warning System:** Due to its relative isolation and reliance on scouts like Lyra, Coppertown could be a place where players gather crucial early intelligence about the Blight's spread through mountainous or remote regions.

**Player Options:**

*   **Investigate the Smelters:** The corroding iron around the smelters is a key anomaly. Is it a precursor to the Blight affecting copper, or a localized phenomenon caused by unique atmospheric conditions near the intense heat and copper fumes?
*   **Secure Trade Routes:** With the world becoming more dangerous, ensuring the safe passage of Coppertown's ore to markets (or the arrival of vital supplies) could be a major questline.
*   **Aid Anya "Sparks":** Her research into non-ferrous alloys could be vital. Players might need to find rare components for her, protect her workshop, or test her inventions.
*   **Explore the Copperhead Mine:** Are there deeper, hidden truths beneath Coppertown? Perhaps ancient warnings or even precursor signs of the Blight in the oldest tunnels.
*   **Diplomacy and Defense:** Players could help Mayor Ironpicket prepare the town's defenses, negotiate with desperate refugee groups, or establish communication with other isolated settlements.
