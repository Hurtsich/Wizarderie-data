## Location: Rust-Creek Mine

**Region:** Outskirts of Anvil's Rest, near the Rusty Creek.

**Type:** Iron Mine (Recently Opened, now Blight-Infested)

**Proprietor (Former):** Likely a small collective of Anvil's Rest smiths or a local entrepreneur who saw potential in a new vein. (Now presumed missing, dead, or transformed).

**Description:**
The Rust-Creek Mine was a recent spark of hope for Anvil's Rest, a new source of iron ore conveniently located near the village. Its opening was met with optimism, promising to supplement the village's existing, perhaps dwindling, resources. The mine is carved into a low hillside, marked by a fresh cut in the earth and the Rusty Creek meandering nearby, its waters once used for sluicing and now carrying tell-tale signs of corruption.

However, this hope was short-lived. Weeks after operations began, miners started falling ill with a strange affliction, their tools showed unnatural corrosion, and an unsettling silence descended upon the site. The mine, once echoing with the sounds of pickaxes and hearty work songs, now exudes a palpable aura of dread and decay. The entrance is likely strewn with hastily abandoned tools, carts, and personal belongings, many already succumbing to the aggressive, orange rust that characterizes the Blight of Iron. A faint, deeply unsettling metallic and rotten odor emanates from the dark, gaping maw of the mine entrance.

**Features:**

*   **Mine Entrance & Staging Area:**
    *   A roughly hewn opening in the hillside, possibly with crudely constructed wooden supports already showing signs of Blight.
    *   Discarded equipment: pickaxes, shovels, ore carts, lanterns – many visibly rusted or broken.
    *   A collapsed or hastily barricaded section just inside the entrance, perhaps a desperate attempt by the last miners to seal something in... or themselves out.
    *   Faint, dragging tracks leading into the darkness.
*   **Upper Tunnels:**
    *   Narrow, damp, and poorly lit. The rock walls are increasingly streaked with orange and crimson Blight corrosion, which seems to pulse with a faint, sickly light in deeper sections.
    *   The air is thick with the smell of rust, damp earth, and something akin to spoiled meat.
    *   Side tunnels, some leading to dead ends, others to small, worked-out ore pockets. These could contain remnants of miners' belongings, desperate scrawlings on the walls, or lurking Blighted creatures.
    *   Pockets of Blight-infused gas or pools of corrosive, rust-colored water.
*   **The Tool Storage Nook:** A small alcove where spare tools, lanterns, and perhaps blasting powder (if used) were kept. This area might be surprisingly untouched or, conversely, a focal point of Blight, with tools fused together in grotesque sculptures.
*   **The Crib Room / Mess Hall:** A slightly larger chamber where miners took breaks. Overturned benches, scattered food remnants (now moldy and metallic), and perhaps a few personal notes or letters never sent. This area could offer poignant clues about the miners' final days.
*   **The Primary Iron Vein Chamber (The Heart-Rust Chamber):**
    *   Located in the deepest accessible part of the mine.
    *   The iron vein here is visibly and grotesquely corrupted. Instead of dull grey ore, it's a pulsating mass of orange, red, and black corrosion. Strange, weeping metallic growths and crystalline Blight formations are abundant.
    *   This is the likely epicenter of the Blight within the mine and could house a more powerful Blighted entity (as suggested in "Cleansing the Vein" quest – a "Forge-Fiend" or "Mother Lode").
    *   The metallic tang in the air is strongest here, and a low, vibrational hum might be felt.
*   **The Escape Tunnel (Collapsed or Hidden):** There might be a secondary, less-used escape route that is now either caved in or deliberately hidden by a terrified survivor. Discovering and clearing this could offer an alternative entry/exit point.
*   **The Rusty Creek's Source:** If the creek itself is a source of the Blight, its underground spring or passage through the mine could be a key contamination point, with water that is almost entirely orange and viscous.

**Lore & Motivations:**

*   **Ground Zero:** Rust-Creek Mine is presented as the primary source of the Blight outbreak affecting Anvil's Rest. Understanding what happened here is key to understanding the Blight itself. Was it a dormant curse awakened by mining? A new, horrifyingly infectious property of this specific iron vein? Or something deliberately introduced?
*   **The Missing Miners:** The fate of the miners is a grim mystery. Are they all transformed into Rust Thralls? Are some dead? Could there be survivors hiding, driven mad by fear and isolation? Finding out what happened to them could provide closure to families in Anvil's Rest or reveal critical information about the Blight's transformation process.
*   **Borin's Suspicions:** Elder Smith Borin Stonehand tasks the players with investigating the mine. His expertise with metals likely led him to connect the unique corrosion he observed (perhaps on the Star-Metal Krys from "The Unraveling Tool" quest) with the rumors from Rust-Creek. He needs confirmation and a way to stop the spread.
*   **Economic and Psychological Impact:** The failure of this new mine, coupled with the Blight it unleashed, is a devastating blow to Anvil's Rest's economy and morale. The villagers are scared, their livelihoods threatened, and their trust in the very earth shaken.
*   **The Nature of the Ore:** Is the iron from this vein inherently different? Did it absorb something ancient and malevolent? Or was it tainted by an external factor – perhaps cultist activity (as hinted with the "Weeping Ore" in "The Prospector's Plea") or a subterranean Blight creature?

**Player Options & Potential Encounters:**

*   **Investigation & Clue Gathering:**
    *   Examine discarded tools and journals for clues about the Blight's first appearance and the miners' reactions.
    *   Analyze samples of the ore and the Blighted growths (Skill checks: Investigation, Nature, Alchemy, or Arcana).
    *   Track Rust Thralls or search for survivors.
*   **Combat & Hazard Navigation:**
    *   **Rust Thralls:** Transformed miners, varying in strength and awareness. Some might still clutch their mining tools, using them as crude weapons. They might be drawn to sound or light.
    *   **Blight Creepers/Swarms:** Mutated cave insects or vermin, now metallic and aggressive.
    *   **Corrosive Hazards:** Pools of blighted water, crumbling tunnels, explosive Blight spores, patches of "Heart-Rust" that drain vitality or corrode equipment.
    *   **The "Heart-Rust" Entity:** A mini-boss encounter in the primary vein chamber. This could be a massive Rust Thrall, a sentient mass of corrupted ore, or a Blight elemental.
*   **Rescue & Moral Dilemmas:**
    *   Players might find miners who are only partially transformed, begging for help or mercy.
    *   A survivor might be found, traumatized and paranoid, who could offer valuable information if calmed and rescued.
*   **Containment or Cleansing:**
    *   Depending on the state of the iron vein, players might need to decide if it can be cleansed (perhaps with a specific ritual, item, or by destroying the "Heart-Rust" entity) or if the mine needs to be sealed off entirely to prevent further spread.
    *   Sealing the mine might involve collapsing tunnels (requiring tools, explosives, or brute force) or finding a way to neutralize the Blight at its source.
*   **Resource Management:** The dark, hazardous environment might require careful management of light sources, healing supplies, and equipment durability (due to corrosive effects).
