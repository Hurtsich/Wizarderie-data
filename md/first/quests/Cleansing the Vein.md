# Quest: Cleansing the Vein

**Campaign:** The Blight of Iron
**Act:** I
**Type:** Main Quest

**Quest Giver:** Borin Stonehand, a respected local smith in Anvil's Rest.

**Prerequisite Quest:** "The Unraveling Tool"

**Description:**
Following the events of "The Unraveling Tool," Borin Stonehand has examined the corrupted Star-Metal Krys. His initial analysis, combined with local rumors of miners falling ill, leads him to believe that the source of the recent Blight outbreak is a small, recently opened iron mine known as 'Rust-Creek Mine,' located on the outskirts of Anvil's Rest. The normally bustling mine has fallen eerily silent. Borin, concerned for the missing miners and the potential spread of the Blight, tasks the players with a dangerous mission. They are to venture into Rust-Creek Mine, clear it of any "Rust Thralls" – miners tragically transformed by the Blight – and determine if the iron vein within can be salvaged or if it's entirely consumed by the corruption. The fate of Anvil's Rest's primary iron source, and potentially the village itself, hangs in the balance.

**Location:**
Rust-Creek Mine, on the outskirts of Anvil's Rest. The mine entrance is a dark, ominous scar in the hillside, with discarded tools and ore carts littering the area, some already showing unnatural orange rust. A faint, unsettling metallic odor hangs in the air, and no sounds of mining activity can be heard. Inside, the mine tunnels are dark, damp, and increasingly corrupted. Patches of aggressive rust crawl across rock surfaces, and strange, weeping metallic growths pulse faintly in the darkness. The air is thick with the smell of decay and corroded metal.

**Objectives:**

1.  **Enter Rust-Creek Mine:** Find a safe way into the mine. The main entrance might be partially collapsed or barricaded from within by terrified, transforming miners.
2.  **Clear the Upper Tunnels:** Navigate the initial sections of the mine, dealing with any Rust Thralls encountered. These were once hardworking miners, now twisted mockeries of their former selves, driven by a primal urge to spread the Blight.
3.  **Locate the Primary Iron Vein:** Delve deeper into the mine to find the main iron deposit that Rust-Creek Mine was established to exploit.
4.  **Assess the Vein's Corruption:** Examine the primary iron vein to determine the extent of the Blight's hold. Is it superficially tainted, or has the corruption burrowed deep into the ore?
5.  **Neutralize Immediate Threats:** Ensure no active Rust Thralls or other Blight-spawned creatures remain a direct threat within the accessible areas of the mine.
6.  **Report to Borin Stonehand:** Return to Anvil's Rest and inform Borin of the mine's status and the fate of the iron vein.

**Challenges & Encounters:**

*   **Rust Thralls:** Miners in various stages of Blight transformation. Some might be slow and shambling, while others could be more aggressive, their mining tools now gruesome weapons. They might retain fragments of their former selves, making encounters potentially tragic. (Use stats for zombies or similar, perhaps with an added corrosive touch attack).
*   **Corrosive Hazards:** Pools of stagnant, rust-colored water, patches of intensely blighted rock that crumble underfoot, or spore-releasing metallic fungi that can cause temporary illness or equipment degradation.
*   **Environmental Puzzles:** Navigating unstable tunnels, bypassing collapsed sections, or dealing with primitive traps set by miners in their final moments of lucidity.
*   **Blight Creepers:** Small, fast-moving Blighted creatures (perhaps mutated cave insects or vermin) that skitter through the tunnels and attack in swarms.
*   **The "Heart-Rust" Chamber (Mini-Boss):** If the vein is heavily corrupted, there might be a larger, more potent Blighted entity at its core – perhaps a "Forge-Fiend" (a miner who was a particularly strong individual or a smith themself, now a hulking mass of rusted iron and pulsing Blight energy) or a "Mother Lode" (a sentient mass of corrupted ore that spawns lesser Blighted creatures).
*   **Moral Dilemma:** Players might encounter miners who are only partially transformed, perhaps pleading for help or mercy, forcing a difficult decision.

**Rewards:**

*   **150 Gold Pieces:** From Borin Stonehand upon successful completion of the objectives.
*   **A Finely Crafted Steel Weapon:** Borin offers a non-magical weapon of the players' choice (e.g., longsword, battleaxe, warhammer, etc.) from his personal, pre-Blight stock. This weapon is of masterwork quality.
*   **Increased Reputation in Anvil's Rest:** Successfully dealing with the mine will earn the players significant gratitude and respect from the villagers, potentially leading to discounts, better information, or further aid.
*   **Crucial Information on the Blight:** The state of the iron vein provides vital clues about the Blight's progression, its effect on raw ore, and its potential contagiousness. This information will be key to understanding the larger threat in Act I.

**Outcomes:**

*   **Success - Vein Salvageable:** The players clear the mine of immediate threats and determine that while tainted, the primary iron vein is not entirely lost. Perhaps the surface layers are corrupted, but deeper sections are still pure, or a specific ritual might be able to cleanse it (a future quest hook). Borin is relieved, and Anvil's Rest has a glimmer of hope.
*   **Success - Vein Lost:** The players clear the mine but find the iron vein is thoroughly corrupted, a pulsating artery of the Blight. It must be sealed off to prevent further spread. Borin is disheartened but grateful for the decisive action. Anvil's Rest will face hardship without its primary iron source, increasing local tensions.
*   **Partial Success:** The players clear most of the mine but are unable to fully assess the deepest parts of the vein due to extreme danger, or they suffer casualties/resource depletion. Borin provides a partial reward and is worried about the unknown.
*   **Failure:** The players are overwhelmed by Rust Thralls or the Blight's hazards and are forced to retreat. The Rust-Creek Mine remains a festering source of corruption, posing an escalating threat to Anvil's Rest. Borin is deeply disappointed, and the villagers' fear grows. The Blight may spread further, potentially requiring more drastic measures later.

**Further Developments:**

*   If the vein is salvageable, Borin or another village elder might ask the players to find a way to cleanse it, leading to quests for rare materials, forgotten rituals, or expert aid (perhaps from a Deep-Dweller or a less conventional smith).
*   If the vein is lost, Anvil's Rest will need a new source of iron. This could lead to quests to explore old, abandoned mines, negotiate with other settlements, or even prospect for new, untainted veins in dangerous territories.
*   The specific nature of the Rust Thralls or any unique Blighted creatures encountered could provide clues to the Blight's origins or weaknesses, prompting further investigation by Borin or other knowledgeable NPCs.
*   The players might recover personal effects from the fallen miners, leading to small, poignant side quests to return these to grieving families in Anvil's Rest.
