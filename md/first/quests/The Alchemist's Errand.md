## The Alchemist's Errand

**Campaign:** The Blight of Iron
**Act:** I
**Type:** Side Quest

**Quest Giver:** Lyra Argentus, an apprentice alchemist of the Obsidian Conclave.

**Description:**
In the bustling mining town of Coppertown, the players are discreetly approached by Lyra Argentus, a visibly nervous young alchemist. She wears the dark, unassuming attire typical of the secretive Obsidian Conclave, but her eyes dart around, and she speaks in hushed, urgent tones.

Lyra explains that her master, Caelan Shadowsteel, a respected but reckless member of the Conclave, was engaged in dangerous research. He was attempting to create an experimental alloy, hoping to understand or even counteract the mysterious "Blight of Iron" that has begun to plague the land. However, the experiment has gone awry. The alloy, a complex and volatile mixture of rare metals and arcane reagents, has become dangerously unstable.

Worse, the alloy has started exhibiting terrifying properties: it seems to attract and energize any blighted metal in its vicinity, causing it to pulse with a sickly energy and accelerating the corrosive effects of the Blight. Lyra fears that if the alloy remains in Coppertown, its growing aura could trigger a significant Blight surge, potentially devastating the town and its vital copper mines.

Caelan, fearing the repercussions from the Conclave and the local authorities, has tasked Lyra with disposing of the unstable alloy. She is too afraid to make the perilous journey herself and lacks the skills to defend herself if something goes wrong. Lyra has sealed the volatile alloy in a specially reinforced, lead-lined container, but she warns that it's only a temporary measure.

She implores the players to transport the sealed container to a designated Dead-Drop location in the desolate and dangerous Ash Wastes. The location is a hollow, petrified tree stump marked with a specific alchemical symbol, known only to a few within the Conclave who deal with hazardous materials. She stresses the urgency â€“ the alloy grows more unstable with each passing hour.

**Location:**
*   **Starting Point:** A quiet alleyway or discreet corner in Coppertown, where Lyra Argentus makes her approach.
*   **Journey:** The route from Coppertown to the Ash Wastes. This journey might involve traversing rocky plains, skirting blighted zones, or navigating treacherous, ash-choked gullies.
*   **Destination:** A specific, marked, hollow petrified tree stump in the Ash Wastes. The Ash Wastes are described as a desolate, perpetually decaying region, once fertile but now consumed by a metallic blight, leaving behind rusted husks and barren land.

**Objectives:**

1.  **Meet Lyra Argentus and accept the task:** Listen to her plea and agree to transport the unstable alloy.
2.  **Safely transport the sealed container:** Journey from Coppertown to the Dead-Drop location in the Ash Wastes. The container must be protected from damage.
3.  **Deposit the container:** Place the sealed container within the marked petrified tree stump.
4.  **Return to Lyra (optional):** If the players wish to confirm completion directly, they might try to find Lyra again in Coppertown, though she may be elusive. Otherwise, the payment is often left at a pre-arranged secondary dead-drop or given upfront.

**Challenges & Encounters:**

*   **The Unstable Alloy:**
    *   **Blight Attraction:** If the players pass too close to already blighted areas or creatures, the alloy might cause these blighted elements to become more aggressive or the blight to temporarily spread/intensify locally. This could manifest as more active rust monsters, blighted creatures showing increased vitality, or even inanimate blighted metal objects trembling or sparking.
    *   **Handle with Care:** If the container is dropped or suffers a significant impact (e.g., during combat or a fall), there could be a minor leakage or surge of energy, potentially causing temporary ill effects on those nearby (e.g., disadvantage on attack rolls, metallic taste, slight corrosion on non-magical metal items).
*   **Journey Hazards:**
    *   **Scavenger Clans:** The Ash Wastes are frequented by Scavenger Clans who might be interested in anything that looks valuable or unusual, including a reinforced container.
    *   **Blighted Creatures:** The Ash Wastes are home to creatures twisted by the Blight (Rust Monsters, early-stage Blightforged Abominations, corrupted wildlife). The alloy might make these encounters more frequent or dangerous.
    *   **Environmental Dangers:** Treacherous footing, ash storms reducing visibility, pockets of corrosive air.
*   **Moral Dilemma (Optional):** Other members of the Obsidian Conclave, or perhaps agents of the Forgewrought Hegemony, might be covertly tracking Caelan's activities. They could intercept the players, demanding to know what they are carrying and why, potentially offering a counter-offer or threatening repercussions.

**Rewards:**

*   **100 Gold Pieces:** As promised by Lyra.
*   **Pouch of three 'Alchemist's Spark':** Small, volatile stones that, when thrown forcefully, create a bright flash and a loud bang, useful for creating diversions or momentarily disorienting foes.
*   **Favor of the Obsidian Conclave (Minor):** Successfully and discreetly completing this task might earn the players a small measure of unspoken gratitude or a contact within the more pragmatic elements of the Obsidian Conclave, should they ever need to deal with them in the future. Lyra might become a useful, albeit secretive, informant.

**Outcomes:**

*   **Success:** The players safely deliver the alloy to the Dead-Drop. Coppertown is spared a potential Blight surge, and the players receive their rewards. Lyra is immensely relieved.
*   **Partial Success:** The players deliver the alloy, but perhaps the container was damaged, causing minor complications, or they attracted unwanted attention. The reward might be slightly reduced, or Lyra might be more anxious about future repercussions.
*   **Failure:**
    *   **Container Breached in Coppertown:** If the players are reckless and the alloy causes a noticeable Blight surge in Coppertown, they will face the wrath of local authorities and the townsfolk. The Obsidian Conclave will disavow any knowledge.
    *   **Lost in Transit:** If the players lose the container or it's taken by others, the unstable alloy remains a threat, and Caelan Shadowsteel's dangerous experiment might fall into the wrong hands or cause a disaster elsewhere. Lyra will be devastated and likely go into hiding.
    *   **Players keep the Alloy:** If the players decide to keep the alloy, they gain a dangerous and unstable item that could have unpredictable effects. This would likely make them enemies of the Obsidian Conclave.

**Further Developments:**

*   The Dead-Drop location might be watched. Who collects the alloy, and for what ultimate purpose? This could lead to further quests investigating the Obsidian Conclave's handling of hazardous materials.
*   Caelan Shadowsteel might learn of the players' competence and seek them out for other "discreet" tasks related to his Blight research, potentially leading them deeper into the mysteries of the Blight of Iron.
*   News of a averted Blight surge in Coppertown (even if the cause is not widely known) could enhance the players' reputation in the region.
