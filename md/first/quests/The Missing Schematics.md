## The Missing Schematics
**Campaign:** The Blight of Iron
**Act:** I
**Type:** Side Quest

**Quest Giver:** Seraphina Forgeborn, Master Smith in Ignisburg.

**Description:**
In the bustling, smoke-filled city of Ignisburg, the players learn of a recent theft from one of its most esteemed, albeit non-magical, artisans. Seraphina Forgeborn, a Master Smith renowned for her incredibly intricate clockwork devices, has had her latest masterpiece's schematics stolen. The plans detail a complex 'Automated Ore Sorter', a device that could revolutionize mining and refining processes in Ignisburg, a city whose lifeblood is metal and ore.

Seraphina, a proud member of the respected Forgeborn family, is a pragmatic woman who relies on precision engineering rather than the Aetherium-laced magic common in the Forgewrought Hegemony. She suspects the theft is the work of either a jealous rival from a lesser, more ambitious forge-family looking to gain an edge, or perhaps an opportunistic member of a Scavenger Clan seeking to sell the plans on the black market or to less scrupulous factions.

The schematics are not just valuable; they are incredibly detailed and, in the wrong hands, could be misused to create faulty machinery, disrupt ore supplies, or even be adapted for nefarious purposes. Seraphina is concerned about her professional reputation but also the potential chaos their misuse could cause. She needs discreet investigators to find out who stole her plans and, most importantly, recover them intact.

**Location:**
*   **Starting Point:** Seraphina Forgeborn's workshop in a respectable district of Ignisburg, likely filled with fascinating clockwork tools and half-finished devices.
*   **Potential Investigation Areas:**
    *   The competitive forge districts of Ignisburg, where rival families might operate.
    *   The shadier underbelly of the city, including markets where stolen goods are fenced.
    *   A Scavenger Clan encampment, possibly located in the outskirts of Ignisburg or in the nearby wilds/ruins where they sift for salvage.

**Objectives:**

1.  **Meet Seraphina Forgeborn:** Hear her account of the theft and gather any initial clues she might possess (e.g., time of theft, any unusual occurrences).
2.  **Investigate Potential Suspects:**
    *   **Rival Forge-Families:** Players might need to subtly gather information, perhaps by posing as interested buyers, new smiths in town, or by observing the operations of competing forges. They might look for signs of sudden innovation or hushed whispers about new projects.
    *   **Scavenger Clans:** This could involve tracking known Scavenger fences in the city or venturing out to one of their encampments. This path might require diplomacy, intimidation, or a trade to get information.
3.  **Identify the Culprit(s):** Determine who is responsible for the theft.
4.  **Recover the Schematics:** Retrieve the plans, preferably without damaging them.
5.  **Return the Schematics to Seraphina:** Report findings and return the plans.

**Challenges & Encounters:**

*   **Social Investigation:** Gathering information in Ignisburg will require tact. Forge-families are proud and secretive. Scavengers are wary of outsiders.
*   **Misdirection:** The initial clues might point to one faction, while another is truly responsible, or perhaps both are involved in different ways (e.g., a rival hired a Scavenger).
*   **Combat (Potential):**
    *   If confronting thieves directly, especially Scavengers who might be more inclined to violence to protect their score.
    *   A less reputable forge-family might employ guards who won't take kindly to snooping.
*   **Environmental Puzzles:** The schematics might be hidden in a complex workshop, a cluttered Scavenger den, or require navigating the industrial maze of Ignisburg.
*   **Moral Dilemma (Optional):** What if the thief had a "sympathetic" reason? (e.g., a desperate smith from a failing family trying to save their livelihood). The players might have to decide between strict adherence to the job and a more nuanced solution.

**Rewards:**

*   **120 Gold Pieces:** As promised by Seraphina.
*   **A Custom-Made Clockwork Trinket:** Seraphina will craft a unique item of minor utility for the party or a specific player. Examples:
    *   **Self-Lighting Pipe:** Never needs tinder.
    *   **Perpetual Calendar Locket:** Always shows the correct date.
    *   **Pocket Weather Vane:** A small, intricate device that accurately predicts minor shifts in local weather for the next hour.
    *   **Mechanized Lockpick Assistant:** Grants a small bonus to attempts to pick simple mechanical locks.
*   **Reputation:** Successfully recovering the schematics will earn the players a good reputation with the Forgeborn family and potentially other artisans in Ignisburg who value skill and discretion.

**Outcomes:**

*   **Success:** The schematics are recovered and returned. Seraphina is grateful, and her work remains secure. The players receive their full reward.
*   **Partial Success:** The schematics are recovered but damaged, or the culprit escapes, leading to lingering resentment from Seraphina or future complications. The reward might be slightly reduced.
*   **Failure:**
    *   The schematics are not recovered. They might fall into the hands of a dangerous group (like the Rust Cults, if they see a way to corrupt the design, or the Obsidian Conclave for their experiments).
    *   The players accuse the wrong party, causing diplomatic incidents or making enemies.
    *   Seraphina's reputation suffers, or a rival successfully uses the plans to their advantage.

**Further Developments:**

*   The thief, if not brought to justice, might become a recurring minor antagonist or a source of further trouble.
*   If a rival forge-family was involved, this could be the start of a larger feud that the players might get drawn into.
*   The schematics, even if recovered, might have been copied. Seraphina might hire the players again if counterfeit or altered versions of her ore sorter start appearing.
*   The clockwork trinket given as a reward might have an unexpected additional feature or become important later.
