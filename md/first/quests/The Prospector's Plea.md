# Side Quest: The Prospector's Plea

**Campaign:** The Blight of Iron
**Act:** I
**Type:** Side Quest

**Quest Giver:** Skip Scrapgather, a frantic prospector in Anvil's Rest.

**Description:**
A disheveled and panicked prospector, Skip Scrapgather, bursts into Anvil's Rest, his clothes torn and eyes wide with terror. He recounts a harrowing tale of venturing deep into the Crucible Peaks with his mining partner, Wren. They were following a promising lead when they stumbled upon a strange, unsettling ore vein – it appeared to be "weeping" a viscous, rust-colored substance. Before they could investigate further, they were ambushed by what Skip describes as "metal men." These assailants, with skin like rusted iron and an unnerving lack of humanity, attacked with brutal efficiency. Skip barely managed to escape, but Wren was captured and dragged away by the metal figures.

Skip is convinced Wren is still alive and desperately pleads with the players to mount a rescue mission. He offers what little he has – 75 gold pieces and an old, hand-drawn mining map that he claims might show a forgotten silver deposit – as a reward for her safe return. He can provide a rough location of their camp and the "weeping" ore vein in the Crucible Peaks.

**Location:**
A small, recently established mining camp in the foothills of the Crucible Peaks. The area will show signs of a struggle. The "weeping" ore vein is located in a nearby shallow cave or mine shaft. The air around the vein feels unnaturally cold, and a faint metallic, sickly sweet smell lingers.

**Unbeknownst to Skip:**
*   The "metal men" are early-stage Rust Thralls – individuals already succumbing to the Blight of Iron.
*   The "weeping ore" is not a new mineral but a raw iron deposit heavily corrupted by the Blight, actively "bleeding" out its corrupting influence. This is a direct manifestation of the Blight's power.

**Objectives:**

1.  **Speak with Skip Scrapgather:** Gather all details about Wren's abduction and the location in the Crucible Peaks.
2.  **Travel to the Mining Camp:** Locate Skip and Wren's camp in the Crucible Peaks.
3.  **Investigate the Camp:** Search for clues about Wren's whereabouts and the nature of her abductors.
4.  **Track the "Metal Men":** Follow any trail left by Wren and her captors.
5.  **Locate the "Weeping Ore" Vein:** The trail will likely lead to the corrupted ore deposit.
6.  **Rescue Wren:** Find Wren (likely held captive near the ore vein or in a small, hastily made prison by the Rust Thralls) and ensure her safety.
7.  **Return to Anvil's Rest (Optional):** Bring Wren back to Anvil's Rest, or at least inform Skip of her fate.

**Challenges & Encounters:**

*   **Rust Thralls (Early Stage):** These will be the primary antagonists. They are not yet as powerful or numerous as those found in more corrupted areas, but they are still dangerous. They might use mining tools as crude weapons and exhibit unnerving strength and resilience. (2-4 thralls initially, perhaps more guarding Wren).
*   **Blighted Wildlife (Minor):** Animals in the vicinity of the "weeping ore" might show early signs of Blight corruption (e.g., rust-colored patches on fur, aggressive behavior).
*   **Environmental Hazard – Weeping Ore:** Proximity to the "weeping ore" could cause minor discomfort (headaches, nausea) or temporary penalties to characters sensitive to corruption if they linger too long without protection. Touching the "weeping" substance directly might risk a minor Blight infection (DM's discretion, perhaps requiring a constitution save to avoid temporary ill effects).
*   **Tracking Challenge:** Following the Rust Thralls' trail might require survival checks.
*   **Wren's Condition:** Wren might be injured, terrified, or even showing early signs of Blight exposure herself, potentially complicating the rescue.

**Rewards:**

*   **75 Gold Pieces:** From Skip Scrapgather upon Wren's rescue or definitive news of her fate.
*   **Skip's Mining Map:** An old, hand-drawn map that, with a successful Investigation or Cartography check, reveals the location of a small, forgotten silver deposit in the Crucible Peaks. This deposit is not Blighted.
*   **Increased Reputation (Minor):** Helping Skip and Wren will earn the players some goodwill in Anvil's Rest, particularly among prospectors and common folk.
*   **Early Warning:** The encounter provides the players with an early, tangible experience of Rust Thralls and Blight-corrupted ore, potentially giving them an advantage in understanding the burgeoning threat.

**Outcomes:**

*   **Success - Wren Rescued:** Wren is saved and returned (or news of her safety is brought) to Skip. They are both immensely grateful. The players receive their full reward.
*   **Partial Success - Wren Rescued, but Blighted:** Wren is rescued, but she is showing early signs of Blight corruption. This could lead to a new dilemma – can she be helped? Does this put Anvil's Rest at risk? Skip is distraught but still pays the reward.
*   **Tragic Success - Wren Found Dead:** The players find Wren, but she has already succumbed to her captors or the Blight. Skip is heartbroken but still gives the players the map (and perhaps a portion of the gold) for their efforts and bringing him closure.
*   **Failure - Players Retreat or Wren is Lost:** The players are unable to overcome the Rust Thralls or fail to locate Wren. Skip is devastated. The Rust Thralls in the area might grow in number or strength, potentially becoming a larger threat later.

**Further Developments:**

*   The "weeping ore" vein could become a point of interest for someone in Anvil's Rest (like Borin Stonehand, if the players inform him), potentially linking to the main quest "Cleansing the Vein" or other investigations into the Blight.
*   If Wren is Blighted, the players might seek a way to halt or reverse her condition, leading them to seek out healers or scholars knowledgeable about the Blight.
*   The silver deposit on Skip's map could become a small source of income for the players or a point of contention if others learn of its existence.
