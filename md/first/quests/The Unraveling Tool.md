## Quest: The Unraveling Tool

**Campaign:** The Blight of Iron
**Act:** I
**Type:** Main Quest

**Quest Giver:** Borin Stonehand, a respected local smith.

**Description:**
The players are approached by a frantic and terrified Borin Stonehand. Borin, a normally jovial and stout dwarf, is known for his exceptional metalwork. However, his workshop and, more distressingly, some of his finest creations have begun to show signs of a strange affliction – patches of unnatural rust, weeping metallic growths, and an eerie silence that has fallen over his once bustling forge. He believes this corruption is a manifestation of the dreaded "Blight of Iron" that has been whispered about in hushed tones.

Borin's most prized possession, a ceremonial dagger named 'The Star-Metal Krys', is kept in a display case within his workshop. This artifact is not only a masterpiece of smithing but is also highly enchanted and crafted from a unique alloy of Star-Iron, a mythical ore said to have celestial properties. Borin believes that the unique composition of The Star-Metal Krys, if retrieved before it's fully consumed by the Blight, might hold clues to understanding the nature of the corruption, and perhaps even a way to combat it. He is too terrified to enter the workshop himself, having barricaded himself in his nearby home. He implores the players to retrieve the dagger.

**Location:** Borin Stonehand's workshop. The workshop is a single-story stone building, usually filled with the clang of hammers and the heat of the forge. Now, an unsettling silence emanates from it. Patches of angry, orange rust crawl across the metal tools and unfinished works. Strange, crystalline metallic growths sprout from the anvils and even the stone walls in places. The air is cold and carries a faint, unsettling metallic tang. The Star-Metal Krys is located in a glass display case in the main workshop area.

**Objectives:**

1.  **Gain entry to Borin's workshop:** The main door is barred from the inside (Borin fled in a panic and barricaded it from the outside, then did the same to his home). Players might need to find another way in (a back window, a chimney, or by forcing the door).
2.  **Navigate the Corrupted Workshop:** The workshop is eerily quiet, but early signs of Blight corruption are evident. Patches of rust seem to spread even as the players watch, and the metallic growths might pulse faintly. There may be minor threats:
    *   **Animated Tools:** A few basic tools (hammers, tongs) might animate with a crude, hostile intelligence due to the Blight's influence.
    *   **Corrosive Hazards:** Touching certain blighted surfaces could cause minor damage or a temporary debility.
3.  **Retrieve The Star-Metal Krys:** The dagger is in a display case. The case itself might be showing signs of blight, and the lock could be rusted or corrupted.
4.  **Return the Dagger to Borin:** Borin is anxiously awaiting the players' return in his barricaded home.

**Challenges & Encounters:**

*   **Environmental Puzzles:** Dealing with the barricaded door, navigating unstable blighted sections of the workshop.
*   **Minor Combat:** Possible encounters with animated tools or small "Rustlings" (early-stage blighted creatures – perhaps insects or small animals that were trapped in the workshop).
*   **Atmosphere:** The primary challenge is the unsettling atmosphere of decay and the unknown nature of the Blight. The workshop should feel like a place that is actively dying and becoming something alien.

**Rewards:**

*   **100 Gold Pieces:** As promised by Borin.
*   **Borin's Gratitude:** Borin is a respected member of the community. His gratitude can lead to discounts on smithing services in the future (if his workshop is cleansed), valuable information, or introductions to other important NPCs.
*   **The Star-Metal Krys (Plot Hook):** While Borin intends to study it, the dagger itself is a significant item. It might exhibit strange behaviors or grant minor boons or visions related to the Blight. Its study will likely be a key step in understanding the broader threat in Act I.

**Outcomes:**

*   **Success:** The players retrieve The Star-Metal Krys. Borin is relieved and grateful, and the dagger becomes a focal point for researching the Blight. The players gain a reputation for courage and resourcefulness.
*   **Partial Success:** The players retrieve the dagger, but it is more corrupted than anticipated, or perhaps one of the players is exposed to a minor Blight effect. The reward might be slightly reduced, or Borin might be more distressed.
*   **Failure:** The players fail to retrieve the dagger (perhaps it's destroyed, or they are driven out of the workshop). Borin is devastated. The opportunity to study this unique artifact is lost, making the investigation into the Blight more difficult. The Blight in the workshop may spread, potentially consuming it entirely and creating a more dangerous localized threat.

**Further Developments:**

*   Examining The Star-Metal Krys could lead to quests to find individuals capable of analyzing its unique properties (Mages, Alchemists, or other Master Smiths).
*   The dagger might reveal specific weaknesses or patterns in the Blight's progression.
*   The Blight in Borin's workshop might spread further, requiring a more direct confrontation or cleansing ritual later.

This quest serves as an early introduction to the Blight, establishes its corrupting nature, and provides the players with their first tangible lead in understanding and combating this new threat.
