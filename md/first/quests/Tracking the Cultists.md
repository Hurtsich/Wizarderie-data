# Quest: Tracking the Cultists

**Campaign:** The Blight of Iron
**Act:** I
**Type:** Main Quest

**Quest Giver:** Elder Rowan Meadowlight (Anvil's Rest Loremaster) or Borin Stonehand (if he has local knowledge connections).

**Prerequisite Quest:** "Cleansing the Vein" (specifically, the outcome where players discover the "weeping gear" symbol).

**Description:**
Following the unsettling events in the Rust-Creek Mine ("Cleansing the Vein"), the players might have discovered a crudely etched symbol – a weeping gear – on discarded mining equipment or a hastily scrawled note left behind by the now-neutralized Rust Thralls. This symbol, initially a mystery, can be identified by Elder Rowan Meadowlight, Anvil's Rest's resident loremaster (or another knowledgeable elder if Rowan is unavailable). She recognizes it with a grim expression as the mark of a newly emerging, dangerous group known as the "Rust Cult."

Concerned by the cult's presence so close to Anvil's Rest and their apparent connection to the Blight, the Elder tasks the players with a crucial investigation. They must follow this disturbing lead, endeavoring to track the cultists to their hidden meeting place. Initial clues or divinations might point towards two potential locations: a suspiciously blighted and unusually silent grove within the Ironwood Forest, or a long-abandoned and forgotten forge on the desolate edge of the Rustlands. The primary goal is to infiltrate their sanctum, observe their activities, and gather intelligence on their immediate plans, particularly any understanding or manipulation they possess concerning the Blight of Iron.

**Location:**
The quest will begin in Anvil's Rest. The trail will lead to one of two potential locations (or the GM can choose one):

1.  **The Weeping Grove (Ironwood Forest):** A once-verdant section of the Ironwood Forest now showing signs of unnatural blight. The trees weep a rust-colored sap, the undergrowth is brittle and decaying, and a faint metallic tang hangs in the air. Strange, guttural chanting might be heard as players approach.
2.  **The Forgotten Forge (Edge of the Rustlands):** An old, dilapidated forge, partially consumed by the creeping decay of the Rustlands. It was abandoned decades ago due to dwindling ore or perhaps an earlier, less understood manifestation of the Blight. Smoke might be seen rising from its crumbling chimney at odd hours.

**Objectives:**

1.  **Identify the Symbol:** Present the "weeping gear" symbol to Elder Rowan Meadowlight or another knowledgeable figure in Anvil's Rest.
2.  **Follow the Trail:** Based on information from the elder or other leads (e.g., questioning locals, finding further discarded symbols), determine the likely direction the cultists traveled. This might involve tracking skills or social investigation.
3.  **Locate the Hidden Meeting Spot:** Discover the cultists' secret gathering place in either the Ironwood Forest or the outskirts of the Rustlands.
4.  **Infiltrate and Observe:** Stealthily enter the cultist hideout and observe their activities. What rituals are they performing? What are they discussing? Are there any maps or documents?
5.  **Gather Intelligence:** Collect information regarding the cult's immediate plans, their numbers, their understanding of the Blight, and any key figures. Specifically, listen for mentions of a "Rust-Priest" named Verdigris.
6.  **Report Findings:** Return to Elder Rowan (or the quest giver) with the gathered intelligence.

**Challenges & Encounters:**

*   **Cultist Sentries:** The hideout will likely be guarded by zealous cultists, possibly armed with crude, rust-infected weapons. (Use stats for bandits or cultists, perhaps with a minor "rust touch" ability that can temporarily degrade armor or inflict a minor Blight effect).
*   **Blighted Wildlife (Ironwood Forest):** If the path leads through the Ironwood, players might encounter forest creatures (wolves, bears, giant spiders) corrupted by the Blight, making them more aggressive and dangerous.
*   **Environmental Hazards:** The chosen location could have its own dangers: unstable structures in the Forgotten Forge, poisonous flora or quicksand-like rust bogs in the Weeping Grove.
*   **Cultist Rituals:** Players might interrupt a ritual, potentially involving corrupted Aetherium or attempts to spread the Blight. This could trigger a direct confrontation or offer a unique opportunity for observation.
*   **The "Weeping Gear" Trap:** The symbol itself might be used to mark traps or ambushes along the trail.
*   **Lower-Ranking Cultists:** Not all cultists are hardened warriors. Some might be recent, desperate recruits who could be intimidated or persuaded to reveal information if isolated.
*   **First Glimpse of Verdigris (Optional):** Players might catch a glimpse of Verdigris from a distance, or find documents signed by him, establishing his authority.

**Rewards:**

*   **200 Gold Pieces:** From Elder Rowan or the village council upon successful completion of the objectives.
*   **Information: The Rust-Priest Verdigris:** Confirmation that a "Rust-Priest" named Verdigris is a key figure leading local cult operations, and potentially some details about his appearance, methods, or goals. This is crucial for future quests.
*   **Increased Reputation in Anvil's Rest:** Successfully uncovering the cult's plans will further solidify the players' reputation as capable protectors of the region.
*   **A Small, Untainted Ore Sample:** Elder Rowan might provide a small piece of unusually pure iron or copper, a symbolic gesture of hope and a practical reward.

**Outcomes:**

*   **Success:** The players successfully locate the hideout, gather significant intelligence about the cult's immediate plans (e.g., a plan to corrupt a local water source, attack a trade caravan, or retrieve a specific artifact), and learn about Verdigris. Anvil's Rest is better prepared for the cult's threat.
*   **Partial Success:** The players locate the hideout but are detected and forced to fight their way out, gathering only limited information. They might learn about Verdigris but miss crucial details about the cult's plans.
*   **Stealthy Success (Bonus):** If players manage to gather all intelligence without alerting the cult to their presence, they might gain a tactical advantage in future encounters, or Elder Rowan might offer a small bonus reward for their discretion.
*   **Failure:** The players fail to locate the hideout, are captured, or are forced to retreat with no significant information. The Rust Cult remains a hidden, growing threat, and their plans proceed unchecked. This could lead to negative consequences for Anvil's Rest in the near future.

**Further Developments:**

*   The intelligence gathered will directly lead to the next main quest, likely focused on thwarting the Rust Cult's immediate plans or directly confronting Verdigris.
*   Specific documents or items found in the cultist hideout could lead to side quests (e.g., rescuing a captive, retrieving a stolen item the cult was targeting).
*   The nature of the cult's understanding of the Blight could offer new research avenues for knowledgeable NPCs like Borin Stonehand or Elder Rowan.
*   If Verdigris is directly observed, his actions or words might provide clues to the Blight's deeper nature or the Rust Cult's ultimate goals.
