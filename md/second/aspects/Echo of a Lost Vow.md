## Aspect: Echo of a Lost Vow

**Description:** This tarnished silver locket, found amidst the detritus of the Great Junk Heap, is surprisingly heavy for its size. Its surface is scratched and dulled, but intricate floral carvings can still be discerned beneath the grime. It hums with a faint, almost inaudible thrumming, a vibration that feels like a distant, sorrowful melody. The locket is slightly warm to the touch, and when held, it evokes a profound sense of longing, a bittersweet ache of a deeply cherished, now broken, promise. It refuses to open, its clasp fused shut by time or some forgotten magic.

**Invocation (Compel):**

*   **Whispers of Sorrow:** At poignant or stressful moments, the holder is overcome by a wave of the locket's inherent sadness, potentially suffering a penalty to tasks requiring emotional fortitude or clear focus. The sorrow might manifest as distracting whispers or fleeting images of a joyful past now lost.
*   **Unwanted Attention:** The locket's faint hum, usually only perceptible to the holder, might become noticeable to entities sensitive to emotional resonances or magical energies (especially those related to memory or loss), drawing unwanted attention in the Heap or from creatures of the Flux.
*   **Echoes of the Past:** In a place or situation that vaguely mirrors the locket's original story (e.g., a scene of betrayal, a moment of profound loyalty, a place where promises were made), the locket's energies might flare, causing minor, unpredictable magical effects or emotional outbursts from the holder.
*   **The Weight of Memory:** The locket feels unusually heavy, both physically and emotionally, imposing a minor encumbrance or a nagging sense of responsibility for a forgotten past.

**Invocation (Advantage):**

*   **Glimmer of Hope/Understanding:** When dealing with themes of lost love, broken promises, or deeply held memories, the holder can draw upon the locket's essence to gain insight, empathy, or a brief flash of understanding into another's motivations or emotional state.
*   **Resonance of Protection:** In a moment of dire need, particularly when protecting someone or upholding a promise, the locket might flare with protective energy, offering a minor boon or ward against despair or abilities that target emotions.
*   **Finding the Lost:** The locket subtly guides its bearer towards things that are lost and cherished, not just objects, but perhaps lost memories, paths, or even lost souls, if only by a faint tug or intuition.
*   **A Moment's Peace:** Clutching the locket and focusing on its hum can provide a brief moment of emotional centering or a bulwark against the chaos and despair of the Great Junk Heap, allowing the holder to make a clarity check.

**Lore & Motivations:**

The locket is more than just a piece of jewelry; it's a repository of a powerful emotional echo. It likely belonged to someone who made a significant vow of love, loyalty, or remembrance.
*   **A Token of Eternal Love:** Perhaps it was a gift between lovers, one of whom was lost or betrayed. The locket now carries the weight of that unfinished love story. Its refusal to open might symbolize the unwillingness to let go or the tragic finality of the separation.
*   **A Memento of a Forgotten Duty:** It could have been a symbol of a sacred oath, a promise to protect something or someone, an oath that was ultimately unfulfilled but not forgotten by the object itself.
*   **Connection to the Great Junk Heap:** The locket ended up in the Heap because the memory it embodies is so potent it resisted being completely unmade or forgotten, much like other significant items in the Heap. Its hum is its "story" trying to be heard.
*   **Quest Hook:** Who did it belong to? What was the vow? Could there be another matching locket, or someone, or something, still searching for this one? Perhaps the locket itself wishes to be reunited with something or to see its vow fulfilled in some way.

**Player Options:**

*   **Seek to Understand:** Players might try to discover the locket's origins, perhaps through research, divination, or by finding other items connected to its past within the Great Junk Heap.
*   **Embrace its Power:** A player might try to attune to the locket, accepting its emotional weight in exchange for greater access to its boons.
*   **Attempt to Open It:** Discovering how to open the locket could be a minor quest in itself. What lies inside? A portrait? A tiny, folded note? Nothing but a burst of pure emotion or memory?
*   **Find its "Counterpart":** The locket might be one of a pair, or intrinsically linked to another person, place, or object that could be sought out.
