## Aspect: Favored by the Collectors

**Description:**
This character has a peculiar and perhaps uneasy alliance with The Collectors, one of the enigmatic factions navigating The Flux. Whether through a past service rendered, a shared esoteric interest, or a strange familial lineage connected to their kind, The Collectors view this character with a degree of favor, or at least marked interest, that sets them apart from others. This doesn'''t necessarily mean friendship; The Collectors''' motives are often inscrutable and their "favor" can be a double-edged sword, bringing unique opportunities but also unwanted obligations and scrutiny. They might occasionally provide cryptic clues, rare artifacts, or unexpected aid, but they might also demand strange prices or steer the character towards their own inscrutable goals.

**Invocation (Compel by GM or Self-Compel for a Fate Point):**

*   **"A Gift from an Unseen Hand":** At a moment of need, a Collector (or their agent) might subtly intervene to help the character, perhaps leaving a crucial item where they can find it, whispering a vital piece of information, or creating a diversion. This aid is never straightforward and might come with unspoken strings attached.
*   **"The Collector'''s Price":** The character is approached by a Collector (or reminded of a past debt) and asked to procure a specific "lost" item, piece of information, or even a person from within The Flux. Refusal could sour their relationship with the faction, while acceptance might lead them into dangerous or ethically ambiguous situations.
*   **"We Know What You Seek":** Because of their connection, The Collectors might possess (or claim to possess) knowledge or an item directly related to the character'''s personal goals or the party'''s current quest. However, bartering with them for it will be a delicate and potentially costly negotiation.
*   **"Unwanted Attention":** The character'''s known association with The Collectors might draw suspicion, fear, or even aggression from other factions or individuals within The Flux who distrust or have been wronged by The Collectors. It could also make them a target for those seeking to exploit their connection.
*   **"Curiosity Killed the Cat... or a Collector'''s Rival":** The Collectors might "guide" the character towards a situation or discovery primarily because it serves the Collectors''' interests in observing, acquiring, or eliminating something or someone, putting the character in the middle of factional squabbles.

**Why this is a good Aspect for The Flux:**

*   **Faction Interaction:** Directly embeds the character within the faction dynamics of The Flux, providing inherent plot hooks and roleplaying opportunities.
*   **Ambiguous Relationship:** The "favor" is not simple loyalty, allowing for complex interactions, mistrust, and shifting alliances.
*   **Resource & Information Conduit:** Provides a unique avenue for the character (and party) to gain access to rare information or items, albeit with complications.
*   **Moral Quandaries:** The Collectors''' demands can lead to interesting ethical dilemmas for the character.
*   **Ties into Mystery:** The inscrutable nature of The Collectors and their motives adds an element of mystery and intrigue to the character'''s story.
