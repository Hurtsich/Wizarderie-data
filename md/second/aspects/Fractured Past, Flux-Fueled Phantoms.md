## Aspect: Fractured Past, Flux-Fueled Phantoms

**Description:**
The character suffers from a significant, traumatic gap in their memory, a past event or period that is lost to them. While the specifics are shrouded, the emotional weight of this forgotten trauma remains, manifesting as a persistent ache of anxiety, sorrow, or irrational fear. Within The Flux, this internal void becomes a dangerous vulnerability. The realm's nature—being a repository of lost things, memories, and echoes—causes fragments of their lost past to surface not as clear recollections, but as distorted, terrifying, or overwhelmingly sorrowful phantoms. These aren't just bad dreams; they are fleeting, sensory experiences – a horrifying visage in the periphery, a scream that only they can hear, a phantom touch of cold dread – that are amplified and made semi-tangible by The Flux's unique properties.

**Invocation (Compel by GM or Self-Compel for a Fate Point):**

*   **"The Walls Have Whispers (And They're Screaming My Name)":** When under stress, in an area resonant with strong emotions, or when encountering specific triggers (which the character may not even consciously recognize), The Flux manifests a phantom from their lost trauma. This could be a fleeting, horrifying image only they see, a disembodied voice whispering accusations or cries of pain, or a sudden, overwhelming wave of the emotion tied to their trauma (e.g., irrational terror, crippling despair, blinding rage). This causes them to falter, lose their next action, act irrationally, or reveal a critical weakness.
*   **"Familiar Threat, Forgotten Foe":** A creature, entity, or even an environment within The Flux bears an uncanny, disturbing resemblance to a forgotten element of their trauma. The character might react with unexplained hostility, crippling fear, or an obsessive need to confront or flee from it, even if it makes no logical sense to their companions. This could lead them into ambushes, cause them to misjudge an NPC's intentions, or waste precious resources on a perceived (but not necessarily real) threat.
*   **"Echoes of Agony":** In moments of intense emotional distress or when The Flux is particularly unstable, the character doesn't just *feel* their trauma, they briefly *relive* a sensory fragment of it. This could be so overwhelming that they are momentarily incapacitated, suffering penalties to their actions or even collapsing, completely vulnerable for a short period. Others might see them reacting to something that isn't there.
*   **"The Unseen Shackle":** The lost memory acts as an invisible barrier or a terrible compulsion. The character might find themselves physically unable to go to a certain type of place, interact with a specific kind of object, or trust a particular type of person, without knowing *why*. In The Flux, these "shackles" can become focal points for strange occurrences or attract entities drawn to such deep-seated, unresolved trauma.

**Why this is a "Trouble" specific to The Flux:**

*   **Amplified by the Setting:** The Flux's inherent nature of manifesting lost memories and emotions makes these phantom experiences more intense, frequent, and potentially tangible than they would be elsewhere.
*   **Exploitable Vulnerability:** Entities native to The Flux, especially the Devourers or manipulative Remnants, could sense this fractured past and exploit it, perhaps by creating illusions based on the trauma or by drawing the character towards dangerous areas resonant with their specific emotional signature.
*   **Internal vs. External Horror:** It blurs the line between the character's internal struggle and the external dangers of The Flux, making it hard for them (and potentially their allies) to distinguish between a genuine threat and a trauma-induced phantom.
*   **Plot Hook Potential:** The drive to understand or overcome this trauma could become a personal quest for the character, leading them to seek out specific locations or entities within The Flux that might hold clues or offer a path to healing (or further pain). For instance, the Glass Ocean could be particularly perilous or enlightening for them.
*   **Character Development:** Confronting these amplified phantoms in The Flux could be a path towards slowly piecing together their lost memory, or at least learning to cope with its echoes, offering significant character development opportunities.
