## High Concept: Heart Tethered to a Ghost in the Flux

**Description:**
This character is defined by a relentless, aching pursuit: to find and reclaim a specific loved one swallowed by the chaotic currents of The Flux. This isn't a vague hope; it's a burning imperative that shapes their every decision and perception. Every Thin Spot explored, every alliance forged, every risk taken is weighed against its potential to lead them to their lost person. The memory of this loved one is a constant, vivid presence, a guiding star in the disorienting landscape of The Flux, but also a source of profound vulnerability and potential delusion. They are a Seeker in the truest sense, but their search is intensely personal and emotionally charged.

**Invocation (Compel by GM or Self-Compel for a Fate Point):**

*   **"I'd Know Them Anywhere!":** The character sees a fleeting glimpse, hears a familiar sound, or catches a scent that powerfully reminds them of their lost loved one. This might compel them to rush into a dangerous or unknown area, abandon a current plan, or mistake a Remnant or Flux illusion for the genuine article, potentially leading to ambush, misdirection, or wasted effort.
*   **"For Them, I'll Risk Anything!":** When an opportunity arises that seems to offer even a sliver of a chance to get closer to their loved one (e.g., a rumor of someone matching their description, a Collector claiming to have information, a path leading to a place significant to their past), the character is driven to take extreme risks, even if it endangers themselves or the party, or requires a significant sacrifice.
*   **Echoes of Shared Pain/Joy:** The character encounters a situation, an object, or a Remnant in The Flux that strongly resonates with a shared memory or experience with their lost loved one. This could trigger an overwhelming emotional response, making them hesitate in a crucial moment, reveal a vulnerability, or become fixated on the echo to the detriment of their immediate surroundings.
*   **Hope Blinds, Despair Binds:** The character's desperation might make them overly susceptible to manipulation by those offering false hope (like a Devourer agent promising reunion in oblivion) or, conversely, a wave of despair might cause them to make reckless or self-destructive choices if the search feels hopeless.

**Why this is a "High Concept" Aspect:**

*   **Core Motivation:** It clearly establishes the character's primary driving force and their reason for being in The Flux.
*   **Emotional Core:** It provides a deep well of emotion for roleplaying and decision-making.
*   **Natural Plot Hooks:** Their search will inevitably lead them to interact with various factions and dangers within The Flux, seeking information, allies, or passage.
*   **Direct Tie-in to The Flux:** The chaotic and deceptive nature of The Flux directly plays upon their hopes and fears, making their search all the more perilous and poignant.
*   **Invokable & Compellable:** The intensity of their desperation and the vividness of their loss provide numerous opportunities for the GM and player to use Fate Points to highlight the character's struggle and drive.
