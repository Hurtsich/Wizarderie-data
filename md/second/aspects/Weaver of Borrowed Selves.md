## Trouble Aspect: Weaver of Borrowed Selves

**Description:**
The character's sense of self is fragmented and porous, like a tapestry woven with threads from forgotten looms. At times, their core identity flickers, and they become entangled with "lost concepts"â€”behaviours, memories, skills, or even personas of beings or ideas that have faded from existence or are adrift within the chaotic currents of reality (or The Flux, if that's a central concept). These shifts are unpredictable and often disorienting, as the character might suddenly possess knowledge they never learned, exhibit personality traits not their own, or feel emotions and motivations alien to them. While this can occasionally offer unexpected advantages, it more often leads to confusion, mistrust, and dangerous misinterpretations of their actions and intentions.

**Invocation (GM Compel or Self-Compel for a Fate Point):**

*   **"Whose Hands Are These?":** In a moment of crisis or when interacting with an object or place resonant with a lost concept, the character's skills or physical demeanour shift. They might suddenly wield a weapon with uncharacteristic expertise (or utter incompetence if the borrowed self is inept), speak in a different accent or language, or perform a complex task they have no training for. This could lead to success in an unexpected way, but also to fumbling a crucial action if the borrowed skill is detrimental or incomplete, or if they lose control at a critical moment.
*   **"Echoes of Another's Heart":** The character is overcome by strong emotions or motivations from a borrowed persona. They might feel a sudden loyalty to a stranger who resembles a figure from the lost concept's "past," an inexplicable fear of a mundane object, or a driving need to complete a task that is meaningless to their true self but was paramount to the borrowed identity. This can lead them to act irrationally, make poor decisions, or alienate their companions.
*   **"A Stranger in the Mirror":** The character's perception of themselves, or how others perceive them, momentarily shifts. They might not recognize their own reflection, or their companions might see fleeting glimpses of someone else in their eyes or mannerisms. This can cause disorientation, identity crises, or lead NPCs to react to them based on the fleeting persona they project, potentially with hostility or misplaced trust.
*   **"Whispers of a Forgotten Life":** Fragments of memories or knowledge from a lost concept bleed into the character's consciousness, offering cryptic clues or dangerous misinformation. They might "remember" details of a place they've never been, know secrets about people they've never met, or be haunted by the traumatic experiences of a forgotten soul. This can be a source of valuable insight but is just as likely to lead them astray or cause them mental anguish.
*   **"Conceptual Contagion":** When exposed to strong thematic elements, powerful artifacts, or areas saturated with psychic residue (especially within a place like "The Flux"), the character is more susceptible to their identity becoming entangled with a dominant or resonant lost concept in the vicinity. They might temporarily adopt the primary goals or fears of a powerful ghost, a defunct ideology, or even a sapient magical item.

**Why this is a "Trouble":**

*   **Unreliability:** The character cannot always control when these shifts happen or what persona/concept they might merge with, making them an unreliable ally in critical situations.
*   **Misunderstanding and Mistrust:** Their erratic behaviour and shifting capabilities can make it difficult for others to trust or understand them.
*   **Internal Conflict:** The constant influx of alien thoughts, emotions, and memories can lead to significant internal conflict, confusion, and a struggle to maintain their core identity.
*   **Vulnerability:** Malicious entities could potentially exploit this instability, attempting to influence or control the character by manipulating the lost concepts they channel. In "The Flux," entities might even try to "imprint" themselves onto the character.
*   **Loss of Agency:** During a strong merger, the character might feel like a passenger in their own body, struggling against the impulses of the borrowed self.

**Lore & Motivation Integration:**

*   **Origin:** What caused this instability? Were they part of a ritual gone wrong? Exposed to a powerful reality-warping artifact? Or is it an inherent trait, perhaps tied to a unique lineage or a brush with cosmic forces?
*   **Motivation:** The character might be driven to find a "cure" or a way to control their shifting identity. Alternatively, they might seek to understand the lost concepts they channel, perhaps seeing themselves as a living archive or a conduit for forgotten voices. They could also fear losing themselves entirely, fighting to preserve their original personality amidst the chaos.
*   **Player Options:**
    *   Embrace the chaos: Allow the shifts to happen and react to the surprising outcomes, good or bad.
    *   Fight for control: Actively try to resist or guide the merging process, perhaps through willpower or specific rituals.
    *   Become a scholar of the lost: Seek out knowledge related to the concepts they channel, trying to understand their origins and significance.
    *   Seek an anchor: Look for people, objects, or beliefs that can help them hold onto their core self.
