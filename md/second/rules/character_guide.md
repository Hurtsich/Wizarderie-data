# Character Creation Guide: Finding Your Way in the Lost & Found Realm

Welcome, Seeker, to the precipice of existence – the Lost & Found Realm, or as it's known to its inhabitants, The Flux. This is a place where reality frays, memories take on tangible form, and the echoes of forgotten ages whisper on the ever-shifting winds. To step into The Flux is to step into a grand, chaotic treasure hunt, a desperate escape, and a profound journey of self-discovery, where confronting what's lost within yourself can be as perilous and rewarding as finding a forgotten god's spark.

Creating your character for "The Great Retrieval: Echoes of the Unmade" is about weaving your thread into the fabric of this fractured reality. You are not just building a set of stats; you are defining a fragment of existence that will brave the maw of oblivion and seek the truth in the heart of what's been forgotten.

## I. Defining Your Core: Aspects – The Threads of Your Reality

Aspects are the lifeblood of your character in The Flux. They are declarative statements about who you are, what defines you, what troubles you, and what connection you have to this strange, beautiful, and dangerous realm. Think of them as anchors in the shifting sands of reality.

You'll start with five key aspects:

1.  **High Concept:** Who *are* you at your core, and what makes you special in The Flux? This is your primary identity, often hinting at your origin or your unique ability to navigate this realm.
2.  **Trouble:** What complicates your life? This isn't just a negative trait; it's a vulnerability, a ticking clock, or a conflict that the GM can use to offer you Fate Points. In The Flux, your Trouble might be deeply tied to something you've lost, a personal trauma, or a strange resonance with the realm itself.
3.  **Three Other Aspects:** These can be anything that further defines your character: a personality quirk, a crucial relationship, a special possession (or a *Found Item* you start with), a memory that defines you, or a skill you thought you'd lost.

**What Makes a Good Aspect in The Flux?**

*   **Evocative and Specific:** "A Seeker" is okay, but "A Seeker Driven by a Lingering Echo of Home" is better. It tells us more about their motivation and connection to the theme of loss.
*   **Actionable and Complicating:** Good aspects can be both invoked (to give you a bonus) and compelled (to introduce a complication). "Always Prepared" is good for invoking; "A Crippling Fear of True Silence" (which the Unmade Queen seeks) is excellent for compelling.
*   **Tied to The Flux:** How does your origin, your past, or your current goals connect to the chaotic nature of the realm, its inhabitants, or the things found within it?
*   **Embrace Loss and Memory:** Your character's journey in The Flux is deeply personal. Your aspects should reflect what you've lost, what you're trying to find, or how the realm's unstable nature affects your identity.

### Aspect Examples for The Lost & Found Realm:

Here are some examples of character aspects tailored to The Flux, generated with the realm's essence in mind:

*   **High Concept Examples:**
    *   **Obsessive Cartographer of the Unmappable Flux:** You are driven by an insatiable need to chart the ever-shifting landscape of the Lost & Found Realm, even if your maps frequently lead you nowhere.
    *   **Echo of the Lost Ages:** You are the last tangible memory of a long-vanished culture, your existence a fragile whisper of what was, constantly at risk of fading.
    *   **Heart Tethered to a Ghost in the Flux:** You are a Seeker, desperate to recover a lost loved one believed trapped or existing as a Remnant within The Flux, making you vulnerable to false hopes and the manipulations of the realm.
    *   **Relic Raider of the Shifting Chaos:** You are a seasoned Collector, drawn to the most dangerous and unstable zones of The Flux in search of unique, forgotten artifacts and concepts, valuing them above all else.

*   **Trouble Examples:**
    *   **Fractured Past, Flux-Fueled Phantoms:** A traumatic lost memory from your past occasionally manifests as terrifying or disorienting phantoms within The Flux, making you vulnerable or causing you to lose focus.
    *   **Weaver of Borrowed Selves:** Your own identity is unstable, occasionally fragmenting or merging with the conceptual echoes of others in The Flux, leading to unpredictable shifts in your personality or skills.
    *   **The Cartographer of Missing Pieces:** You possess an insatiable, reckless addiction to discovering new 'lost things,' always pushing deeper into danger for the thrill of the next find, often ignoring caution or the needs of your companions.

*   **Other Aspect Examples:**
    *   **Echoes of the Lost Companion:** You carry a 'lost item' that is subtly sentient, a fragment of a forgotten companion or a piece of a powerful concept, which sometimes offers cryptic guidance or causes unpredictable effects.
    *   **Favored by the Collectors:** You have a unique, perhaps uneasy, relationship with the Grand Bazaar Collective, granting you access to rare finds but also entangling you in their ruthless schemes.
    *   **The Shardmind Seer:** You possess an uncanny knack for perceiving and understanding fragmented memories, whether from the environment, 'found items,' or even other characters, but this insight can be overwhelming.

## II. Mastering the Fragments: Skill Selection

Your skills represent your character's capabilities, but in The Flux, even these can be subject to the realm's instability. While your core skills are generally reliable, the unique nature of this dimension means you might temporarily gain or lose proficiencies based on your discoveries or the realm's influence.

When selecting your skills, consider:

*   **Your Origin:** What did your character do before entering The Flux? Were they a scholar, a soldier, a rogue, a scientist? This will inform your foundational skills.
*   **Survival in The Flux:** What skills are most vital for navigating this chaotic realm? Notice, Investigate, Will, Lore, Physique, and Stealth are often invaluable.
*   **Your Aspects:** Do your skills logically flow from your aspects? If you are a "Relic Raider," Investigate and Resources (for trading 'found items') might be high. If you are an "Echo of the Lost Ages," Lore might be your defining skill.

**Skill List (FATE Core Standard, adapted for The Flux):**

*   **Athletics:** Running, jumping, climbing, dodging, physical endurance against shifting terrain.
*   **Burglary:** Picking locks, disabling traps, sneaking into secure (or forgotten) areas, handling delicate mechanisms of 'found' contraptions.
*   **Contacts:** Knowing people, finding information, navigating social circles (even in the Grand Bazaar), tracking down lost individuals or factions.
*   **Drive:** Operating vehicles (even strange, forgotten ones), navigating through unstable zones, quick reactions.
*   **Empathy:** Reading emotions, sensing hidden truths, understanding the fragmented feelings of Remnants or memory echoes, providing "therapy" to others.
*   **Fight:** Close-quarters combat, using traditional or improvised weapons against manifestations.
*   **Investigate:** Finding clues, noticing hidden details, piecing together fragments of lost lore or object functions, searching for 'lost things'.
*   **Lore:** Knowing things, recalling forgotten histories, understanding strange concepts, deciphering ancient languages, identifying 'found items' and their purpose. This is key for **Recalling** Lost Skills or memories.
*   **Notice:** Awareness of your surroundings, spotting dangers, finding hidden Thin Spots or 'lost things'.
*   **Physique:** Physical strength, enduring harm, shrugging off environmental effects, carrying heavy 'found' objects.
*   **Provoke:** Intimidating, annoying, or inciting others, using fear or anger to manipulate, psychically attacking creatures of pure emotion.
*   **Rapport:** Building trust, charming, persuading, negotiating, defusing tense situations with Remnants or Custodians, helping others **Confront Loss**.
*   **Resources:** Your ability to acquire and spend money or valuable 'found items'. In The Flux, this might mean trading rare forgotten concepts for passage or bartering memories.
*   **Shoot:** Ranged combat with firearms or other projectile weapons against manifestations.
*   **Stealth:** Hiding, moving unseen, avoiding detection by predatory Remnants or Devourer patrols.
*   **Will:** Mental fortitude, resisting mental attacks or compulsions, maintaining focus in chaos, processing traumatic memories, understanding Realm Glimmers.

**Skill Pyramid:** Distribute your skills in a pyramid structure:
*   One skill at Great (+3)
*   Two skills at Good (+2)
*   Three skills at Fair (+1)

## III. Glimmers of Past Genius: Creating Stunts and Refresh

Stunts are unique abilities that either give you a bonus to a skill roll in a specific situation, or allow you to do something unique that bypasses a limitation. In The Flux, stunts can also represent **Found Stunts** – temporary abilities gained from powerful 'lost things' or profound memories.

You start with **three free stunts**. Your character begins with a **Refresh of 3**. This is the number of Fate Points you'll typically start each game session with. Each additional stunt you choose beyond the initial three free ones reduces your Refresh by 1.

**What Makes a Good Stunt for The Flux?**

*   **Reflect Your Aspects:** Your stunts should reinforce your High Concept or other aspects. If you're a "Shardmind Seer," a stunt related to Lore or Empathy for reading memories would be fitting.
*   **Enhance Skills in Unique Ways:** Instead of just "+2 to Fight," think about *how* your Fight skill is unique. Perhaps it's tied to a forgotten martial art, or you can use found objects as improvised weapons with particular flair.
*   **Embrace the Chaotic/Memory Theme:** Can your stunt relate to manipulating the realm's instability (Realm Glimmers), recalling forgotten skills, or using 'found items' in unusual ways?
*   **Provide Narrative Richness:** A good stunt should inspire interesting fiction at the table.

### Stunt Examples for The Lost & Found Realm:

*   **The Archivist's Recall (Lore):** When you **Overcome** an obstacle by recalling a specific historical event or forgotten lore, and you have an Aspect like *Echo of the Lost Ages* or *Librarian of the Forgotten*, you can spend a Fate Point to gain +4 instead of +2 on your Lore roll.
*   **Echo of the Unmade Blade (Fight):** When you use an improvised weapon or a 'found' weapon with a **Found Item Aspect** related to conflict (e.g., *Sliver of a Lost Sword*), you can **Attack** by conjuring a temporary, sharp edge of pure concept, treating your Fight skill as one step higher for that attack. If you succeed with style, you can also **Create Advantage** "A Glitch in Their Aura" on your opponent.
*   **Thin Spot Navigator (Notice):** When you **Create Advantage** to locate a Thin Spot or navigate a complex, shifting landscape, if you have an Aspect like *Obsessive Cartographer*, you can spend a Fate Point to ask the GM one specific question about the safest or fastest route, and they must answer truthfully.
*   **Memory Palace Defense (Will):** When you **Defend** against a mental attack or a **Memory Echo** Compel, if you succeed, you can immediately **Create Advantage** on your attacker by manifesting a disorienting fragment of *their* lost thoughts or overwhelming them with chaotic memories.
*   **Collector's Instinct (Investigate):** When you **Investigate** a scene specifically to find a valuable 'lost thing,' if you succeed with style, you discover not only the item but also a clue or hint about its previous owner or significant history, allowing you to **Create Advantage** `Whispers of the Past` on the item.
*   **Glitch Weaver (Lore/Will):** When you use a Realm Glimmer (see Ruleset, `Realm Glimmers` section) to **Create Advantage** by manipulating the environment, you can accept a minor **Realm Glitch** (GM's choice) to gain +3 to your roll instead of the usual +2 for invoking an Aspect. This stunt represents your uncanny ability to intentionally provoke the realm's instability.

## IV. Resilience and Harm: Stress & Consequences

In The Flux, harm isn't just physical; it's also the erosion of your mind and identity. Your character has two stress tracks and three consequence slots to absorb damage from conflicts.

*   **Physical Stress Track:** Your character has a Physical stress track with **2 stress boxes**. This represents bodily harm from creatures, environmental hazards, or the sheer fatigue of surviving.
*   **Mental Stress Track:** Your character also has a Mental stress track with **2 stress boxes**. This represents cognitive overload, psychic attacks, memory siphoning, or the emotional toll of encountering profound loss.

**Consequence Slots:** You have three consequence slots, which can be used to absorb overflow stress from attacks:
*   **Mild Consequence:** (e.g., *Winded*, *Shaken*, *Flickering Memory*)
*   **Moderate Consequence:** (e.g., *Cracked Ribs*, *Deep-Seated Paranoia*, *Fragmented Identity*)
*   **Severe Consequence:** (e.g., *Limb Lost*, *Catatonic Stupor*, *Memory Purged*)

Remember, a **Memory Purged** (Severe Mental Consequence) is unique to The Flux, representing a permanent loss of a major memory or even a Personal Aspect.

## V. Example Characters: Seeds of Self

Here are a couple of brief character concepts to inspire your own journey into The Flux. These are not full character sheets, but illustrate how Aspects and core concepts intertwine.

### Example 1: The Scholar of Scattered Truths

*   **High Concept:** **Wandering Archivist of Forgotten Histories**
*   **Trouble:** **Haunted by a Lost Hypothesis** (A philosophical concept she once pursued, now a mental trap in The Flux)
*   **Other Aspects:** *A Glimmer of a Grand Library*, *Relies on Logic, Not Luck*, *Bound to the Custodians' Purpose*
*   **Skills:** Lore (+3), Investigate (+2), Will (+2), Notice (+1), Rapport (+1), Resources (+1)
*   **Stunts:**
    *   **Echoing Archives:** When you **Overcome** an obstacle using Lore to recall a piece of forgotten history, if you succeed with style, you also **Create Advantage** on the scene, establishing a relevant *Historical Resonance* Aspect.
    *   **Logic Untangled:** When you **Defend** against any compel related to a logical fallacy or misleading information, you gain +2 to your Will roll.
    *   **The Archivist's Eye:** When you **Investigate** a 'found item' to determine its purpose or origin, you can spend a Fate Point to immediately learn one minor truth about it, even if you fail your roll.
*   **Refresh:** 3 (starts with 3 free stunts)

### Example 2: The Resilient Survivor

*   **High Concept:** **World-Weary Guide Through the Bleeding Realities**
*   **Trouble:** **Too Many Scars, Too Few Memories** (His body is tough, but his past is a painful blur, making him vulnerable to memory manipulation)
*   **Other Aspects:** *Always Finds a Way Out*, *A Kindred Spirit to Lost Souls*, *Carries a Beloved, Broken Compass*
*   **Skills:** Physique (+3), Athletics (+2), Drive (+2), Fight (+1), Notice (+1), Empathy (+1)
*   **Stunts:**
    *   **Unbroken Spirit:** When you are taken out by a physical consequence, you can choose to instead take a **Mental Consequence** related to despair or memory loss, allowing you to remain in the scene.
    *   **Pathfinder's Instinct:** When you **Overcome** an obstacle involving navigating difficult or shifting terrain, you can use Athletics instead of Drive or Notice. If you succeed with style, you also find a useful 'lost item' relevant to the area.
    *   **Compass Bearing:** When you **Overcome** an obstacle to find a stable exit or a specific location in The Flux, if your *Broken Compass* Aspect is invoked, you gain +3 instead of +2.
*   **Refresh:** 3 (starts with 3 free stunts)
