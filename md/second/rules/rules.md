# The Echoes of Reality: A FATE Core Ruleset for the Lost & Found Realm

In the Lost & Found Realm, reality is a fickle thing, woven from forgotten memories, misplaced objects, and the shattered remnants of forgotten concepts. This ruleset adapts the FATE Core system to reflect this volatile existence, where identity can shift like sand, and every found object tells a story – or hides a danger. Your journey is one of discovery, survival, and confronting the echoes of what once was.

---

## I. Core Mechanics: The Shifting Self

### 1. Aspects: Threads of Reality

Aspects are the bedrock of the Lost & Found Realm, representing not just your character's traits but the fleeting nature of reality, recovered memories, the unique properties of 'found' items, and the inherent instability of the environment.

*   **Personal Aspects:** Beyond your core identity, these can reflect temporary shifts in memory, a sudden understanding of a forgotten skill, or the psychic impact of the realm. A character might temporarily gain an Aspect like *A Memory of Childhood Joy* or *Touched by the Glitch*.
*   **Lost & Found Item Aspects:** Every significant 'found thing' carries its own Aspect, detailing its unique properties or the forgotten history clinging to it. An old pocket watch might be *Always Five Minutes Fast*, or a faded photograph, *A Glimpse of a Vanished City*. These can be invoked or compelled like any other Aspect.
*   **Scene & Environmental Aspects:** The very landscape is constantly shifting. A scene might be defined by *Reality Warps Here*, *Echoes of a Grand Ball*, or *Beneath a Sky of Forgotten Dreams*. These are powerful tools for the GM to reflect the realm's chaos and can be interacted with by players.
*   **Invoking Aspects:** Spend a Fate Point to add +2 to a roll or gain a reroll, tying into the forgotten power or fleeting stability represented by the Aspect.
*   **Compelling Aspects:** The GM offers a Fate Point to complicate your character's life based on an Aspect, perhaps by forcing you to relive a painful memory (*Haunted by the Unseen Sorrow*) or being led astray by a misleading 'found' object (*The Lure of the False Horizon*). You can accept for the Fate Point or refuse by spending one of your own.

### 2. Skills: The Fragmented Mind

Skills in the Lost & Found Realm represent your character's capabilities, but their reliability can be influenced by the realm's instability and your own fluctuating memories. While your core skills remain, specific memories or 'lost skills' can be temporarily accessed or forgotten.

*   **Core Skills:** Your foundational abilities (e.g., Drive, Fight, Investigate, Lore, Notice, Physique, Provoke, Rapport, Shoot, Stealth, Will, Resources). These are generally stable.
*   **Lost Skills:** Some skills might be forgotten or fragmented due to the realm's influence. Occasionally, by finding a specific memory or object, a character might temporarily gain a proficiency they didn't know they had, granting a temporary skill rank or a bonus to specific actions. This usually manifests as an Aspect (e.g., *Muscle Memory of a Forgotten Craft*).
*   **Memory-Dependent Actions:** Certain actions might explicitly require a successful Lore or Will roll to access a specific memory or piece of forgotten knowledge before attempting the primary skill roll.

### 3. Stunts: Glimmers of Past Genius

Stunts represent unique abilities or specific talents, often tied to a character's core identity or the lingering echoes of lost skills.

*   **Personal Stunts:** Your character's inherent specializations.
*   **Found Stunts:** Rare 'found items' or profound memories might grant a temporary stunt, allowing a unique action or bonus relevant to that specific discovery. This might last a scene, a session, or until a specific condition is met (e.g., an ancient compass grants *Pathfinder of the Non-Euclidean* for one scene).
*   **Volatile Stunts:** Some stunts gained from the realm might be unstable. Using them too often, or failing a roll while using them, could trigger a minor **Realm Glitch** (see below).

### 4. Stress & Consequences: Erosion of Self

The realm's inherent instability takes a toll. Beyond physical and mental harm, characters can suffer from the erosion of their memories and even their identity.

*   **Stress Tracks:** Standard Physical and Mental Stress tracks.
    *   **Physical Stress:** Represents bodily harm from creatures, environmental hazards, or the sheer fatigue of surviving.
    *   **Mental Stress:** Represents cognitive overload, psychic attacks, memory siphoning, or the emotional toll of encountering profound loss.
*   **Consequences:** As in FATE Core, these represent lasting harm.
    *   **Mild:** *Winded*, *Shaken*, *Flickering Memory*.
    *   **Moderate:** *Cracked Ribs*, *Deep-Seated Paranoia*, *Fragmented Identity*.
    *   **Severe:** *Limb Lost*, *Catatonic Stupor*, *Memory Purged*.
*   **Memory Purged (Severe Mental Consequence):** A character loses a major memory or even a Personal Aspect. This Aspect is permanently removed and replaced with a new, often negative or vacant, one (e.g., *Lost My Purpose*, *A Blank Slate*). This can only be recovered through a specific **Confronting Loss** scenario.
*   **Taken Out:** When a character is taken out, they are no longer in the scene. The GM describes what happens to them, often involving being lost in the realm's chaos, perhaps to reappear later with a new (or lost) Aspect, or even in a different location.

### 5. Fate Points: Echoes of Will

Fate Points are your character's ability to assert their will against the realm's chaos, tap into forgotten power, or find a moment of clarity.

*   **Gaining Fate Points:**
    *   **Accepting Compels:** The most common way, particularly from the realm's shifting nature or the burdens of lost memories.
    *   **Declaring a Story Detail:** For a brief moment, you assert a small detail of reality or a hidden connection (e.g., "I remember seeing a similar sigil once!").
    *   **Conceding a Conflict:** You choose to lose, but on your own terms, shaping the narrative of your defeat.
*   **Spending Fate Points:**
    *   **Invoking Aspects:** Gain a bonus or reroll.
    *   **Declaring Story Details:** Make a significant detail true (e.g., "I spend a Fate Point to reveal this old compass is the key to finding a stable exit!").
    *   **Gaining a Bonus:** Add +1 to any roll, even after the dice are cast, or grant another character +1.
    *   **Refusing a Compel:** When you don't want to follow the GM's suggested complication.
    *   **Activating Found Powers:** Some powerful 'found things' may require a Fate Point to unleash their full potential.

## II. Actions in the Realm

All actions in the Lost & Found Realm fall into FATE's four core categories, adapted to the chaotic setting.

### 1. Overcoming the Impossible

*   **Purpose:** To achieve a specific goal against opposition or to navigate the realm's inherent chaos.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Successfully navigating a stretch of reality-warped terrain (Overcome with Drive or Physique).
    *   Recalling a crucial, buried memory (Overcome with Lore or Will).
    *   Retrieving a 'lost thing' from a dangerous manifestation (Overcome with Stealth or Fight).
    *   Resisting the pull of an alluring, but dangerous, 'memory echo' (Overcome with Will).

### 2. Creating Advantages from Chaos

*   **Purpose:** To establish a beneficial fact, create a new Aspect, or discover an existing one that helps you or hinders an opponent.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Spotting a hidden 'thin spot' leading to a new area (Create Advantage with Notice).
    *   Manipulating the realm's instability to briefly manifest a helpful object (Create Advantage with Lore, Will, or a specific `Realm Glimmer` Aspect).
    *   Understanding the forgotten function of a 'found item' (Create Advantage with Lore or Investigate).
    *   Drawing out a specific emotional response from a manifestation of loss (Create Advantage with Empathy or Provoke).

### 3. Attacking Manifestations

*   **Purpose:** To inflict stress and consequences on an opponent.
*   **Opponents:** Not just living beings, but also 'manifestations of loss' (creatures formed from forgotten pain), rogue constructs, or other treasure hunters.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Physically engaging a distorted creature (Attack with Fight or Shoot).
    *   Psychically overloading a memory-siphoning entity (Attack with Will or Provoke).
    *   Using a 'found item' with offensive properties to blast a barrier (Attack using its unique properties).

### 4. Defending Against Oblivion

*   **Purpose:** To prevent incoming attacks from inflicting stress or consequences, or to resist the realm's insidious effects.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Dodging a collapsing reality pocket (Defend with Athletics).
    *   Shrugging off a psychic assault from a forgotten god's echo (Defend with Will).
    *   Warding off a creature of oblivion with a light source (Defend with Provoke or using a specific 'found' item Aspect).
    *   Resisting the urge to give in to despair when confronted with overwhelming loss (Defend with Will).

## III. Special Realm Rules

### 1. Lost & Found Things: The Currency of the Realm

The Lost & Found Realm is defined by its contents. Characters are constantly discovering 'lost things' – from the mundane to the miraculous, from the tangible to the conceptual.

*   **What are Lost Things?**
    *   **Objects:** Misplaced items, forgotten relics, fragments of vanished civilizations.
    *   **Memories:** Personal recollections, historical events, forgotten languages, lost songs.
    *   **Concepts:** Vanished laws of physics, forgotten philosophies, abandoned artistic movements.
    *   **Echoes:** Faint imprints of powerful entities, places, or emotions.
*   **Discovering Lost Things:**
    *   **Scavenge (Create Advantage with Notice/Investigate):** Actively searching a location for forgotten objects or clues. Success creates a **Found Item Aspect** on the scene or for the character.
    *   **Recall (Overcome with Lore/Will):** Attempting to pull a specific memory or piece of forgotten knowledge from the realm's ether or your own fragmented mind. Success may grant a temporary **Memory Aspect** or a brief **Lost Skill**.
    *   **Sense (Create Advantage with Empathy/Notice):** Perceiving an emotional imprint or a subtle anomaly that indicates a 'lost thing' nearby.
*   **Using Lost Things:**
    *   Once discovered, a 'lost thing' can manifest as a **temporary Aspect** or a **temporary Stunt**.
    *   **Invoke:** Players can invoke the Aspect of a 'found thing' for a bonus, just like any other Aspect.
    *   **Declare Story Detail:** A player can spend a Fate Point to declare a minor truth about a 'found thing' or how it can be used.
    *   **Unstable Power:** Some 'found things' are powerful but unstable. The GM might compel their use, or a failed roll while using them could trigger a **Realm Glitch**.
*   **Realm Glitches:** The realm's instability can manifest in unexpected ways. If a roll fails dramatically, or if a 'found thing' is pushed too hard, a **Realm Glitch** can occur. The GM can:
    *   Introduce a new, temporary **negative Aspect** on the scene or a character.
    *   Shift a positive Aspect of a 'found thing' to a negative one.
    *   Cause a minor, temporary reality warp (e.g., gravity briefly reverses, colors invert).
    *   Trigger a minor, localized `Memory Echo` (see below).

### 2. The Shifting Landscape: Environmental Aspects

The Lost & Found Realm is in constant flux. The GM should regularly introduce or change **Scene Aspects** to reflect this.

*   **Changing Aspects:** At the start of a new scene, or at dramatic points within one, the GM can introduce a new Scene Aspect or replace an existing one. For instance, *A Wall of Forgotten Dreams* might become *A Chasm to Oblivion*.
*   **Environmental Hazards:** These aspects can be compelled by the GM to complicate actions, or invoked by players with clever ideas (e.g., invoking *Unpredictable Vortices* to sweep away an opponent).

### 3. Memory Echoes & Identity Shifts

The realm can impose forgotten memories or even alter a character's sense of self.

*   **Memory Echoes (Compels):** At opportune moments, the GM can offer a Fate Point to compel a character based on a **Memory Aspect** (either one the character possesses or one permeating the scene). This might cause a character to relive a traumatic event, become confused by a forgotten concept, or be drawn to a specific location by an emotional resonance.
*   **Identity Shifts (Consequences):** Severe mental consequences or prolonged exposure to particularly strong 'lost concepts' can lead to an `Identity Shift`. This involves permanently changing or adding a Personal Aspect, reflecting a fundamental alteration to the character's perception of self (e.g., from *A Stubborn Optimist* to *Haunted by What Was Lost*).

### 4. Confronting Loss: A Path to Healing

The "therapy" theme is represented by characters actively seeking to resolve personal 'Lost Aspects' (negative Aspects stemming from their own forgotten pasts or traumas).

*   **Initiating Confrontation:** A character declares they wish to confront a specific `Lost Aspect` (e.g., *My Forgotten Family*, *The Guilt of What I Left Behind*). This usually requires a quiet moment, a specific trigger (like finding a related item), or the assistance of another character.
*   **The Struggle:** This becomes a special challenge or conflict. It might involve:
    *   **Overcome Rolls:** To process emotions (Rapport), recall details (Lore), or endure the pain (Will).
    *   **Aspect Creation:** The player might `Create Advantage` by establishing temporary Aspects like *A Wave of Sadness* or *A Glimmer of Understanding*.
    *   **Internal Conflict:** The GM might treat it as a mental conflict, with the character fighting against the negative influence of the `Lost Aspect` itself.
*   **Resolution:**
    *   **Success:** The `Lost Aspect` is either removed permanently, or transformed into a new, positive Aspect (e.g., *My Forgotten Family* becomes *Honoring My Ancestors' Memory*). This might also grant a new **Stunt** reflecting growth, or recover a **Lost Skill**.
    *   **Failure:** The character takes mental stress/consequences. The `Lost Aspect` might remain, or even shift to a more severe or twisted form (e.g., *The Guilt of What I Left Behind* becomes *A Shroud of Self-Loathing*).

### 5. Realm Glimmers: Manipulating Reality

Some characters, or specific 'found items', can tap into the realm's inherent instability to cause strange effects. This is not traditional 'magic' but rather the manipulation of forgotten laws and chaotic energies.

*   **Source of Power:** Characters with Aspects like *Touched by the Glitch*, *One with Forgotten Echoes*, or through using powerful **Found Item Aspects**.
*   **Actions:** Primarily `Create Advantage` or `Overcome`, but sometimes `Attack`.
    *   **Create Advantage:** Manipulating the environment (e.g., causing a wall to temporarily ripple and open a path), revealing a hidden truth by briefly stabilizing a memory echo.
    *   **Overcome:** Reshaping a small part of the immediate reality to bypass an obstacle (e.g., making a gap briefly bridge itself), or forcing a `Lost Thing` to yield its secrets.
    *   **Attack:** Very rarely, using the realm's chaos to directly harm an opponent by causing a localized reality warp or overwhelming them with fragmented thoughts.
*   **Cost:** Using Realm Glimmers often requires spending a Fate Point, or accepting a GM Compel for a **Realm Glitch** or a **Memory Echo** as a side effect. Pushing it too far might result in Mental Consequences.
