## Trouble Aspect: Cracks in Reality's Facade

**Description:**
The character is afflicted by Veil Sickness, a condition that erodes their perception of reality and instills a deep-seated paranoia. The constant, subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) bleeding of Phantasma's influence into the world has taken its toll, making it increasingly difficult for them to distinguish between what is real, what is an illusion, and what is a manifestation of their own fractured mind. They see patterns where there are none, suspect hidden motives in even the most benign actions, and feel the unnerving presence of unseen watchers or spiritual incursions.

**Lore & Motivations:**

*   **Product of the Bleed:** The character's Veil Sickness is a direct result of exposure to areas where the Spirit Veil is thin, intense Phantasmal energies, or perhaps even a direct encounter with a powerful Echo or a ritual gone awry.
*   **Constant Vigilance (Misguided):** Their paranoia isn't entirely unfounded in a world like Umbraxis, but it's amplified and distorted by their sickness. They are hyper-aware of their surroundings, but their interpretations are skewed, leading them to erroneous conclusions and mistrust.
*   **Fear of Losing Themselves:** A core fear is the complete loss of their sanity and identity, of becoming a puppet for unseen forces or dissolving into the chaotic whispers of the Veil. This can drive them to desperate measures to find a "cure" or to cling to anything they believe to be undeniably real.
*   **Unreliable Narrator:** Their perception is inherently unreliable. What they report as truth might be a hallucination, a misinterpretation, or a genuine insight that others dismiss due to their condition.

**Invocation (How the Player Can Use This Aspect - typically compelled, but a clever player might invoke it for a specific, risky benefit):**

*   **Erratic Insight:** Rarely, their paranoia might latch onto a genuine threat that others miss, perceiving a subtle clue through the lens of their distorted reality (e.g., "Because I see *Cracks in Reality's Facade*, I notice the slight shimmer around that assassin that everyone else dismisses as a heat haze!"). This is risky, as it's usually wrong.
*   **Unpredictable Defense:** An enemy trying to deceive or manipulate them might find it unexpectedly difficult because the character's paranoia makes them distrust *everything*, including genuine-seeming ploys. (e.g., "My *Cracks in Reality's Facade* make me immune to your honeyed words; I know you're all out to get me!").

**Compel (How the GM Can Introduce Complications):**

*   **Misinterpreting Reality:** The character sees threats, conspiracies, or malevolent intent where there is none, causing social friction, tactical errors, or drawing unwanted attention. (e.g., "Your *Cracks in Reality's Facade* convince you the friendly merchant is a Veiled Hand agent in disguise, and you act accordingly.")
*   **Hallucinations & Sensory Distortions:** The character experiences vivid hallucinations – whispers, fleeting figures, shifting environments – that distract them, lead them astray, or cause them to react to non-existent stimuli. (e.g., "As the *Cracks in Reality's Facade* widen, the walls seem to whisper dire warnings, compelling you to abandon your post.")
*   **Paranoid Outbursts:** The character accuses allies of betrayal, refuses to trust vital information, or becomes paralyzed by indecision due to overwhelming suspicion. (e.g., "The *Cracks in Reality's Facade* make you certain your allies are leading you into a trap, and you refuse to cross the bridge.")
*   **Drawing Unwanted Attention:** Their erratic behavior or panicked reactions to illusions/hallucinations might alert enemies to their presence or reveal their compromised mental state.
*   **Vulnerability to Manipulation:** While generally paranoid, they might latch onto a specific, comforting "truth" offered by a manipulator who knows how to exploit their condition, mistaking it for a moment of clarity. (e.g., "The cultist's words seem to pierce through the usual fog of your *Cracks in Reality's Facade*, offering a 'clear' explanation, and you find yourself believing them.")
*   **Physical/Mental Toll:** A particularly strong wave of Veil Sickness symptoms (triggered by stress or environmental factors) could impose a temporary negative condition or make them lose their next action as they wrestle with their perceptions.
