# High Concept Aspect: Missing Mentor of Forbidden Truths

**Description:**
Theronius Lumian is (or was) an **Elderly Luminary of Theronian History**, a widely respected, if somewhat eccentric, scholar. His life has been a delicate balancing act: a deep-seated Aurosian desire for **Truth and Stability** constantly wars with an insatiable, almost reckless, **Curiosity about the Veil's Mysteries**. This potent blend made him a preeminent authority but also led him to delve into areas of study others deemed dangerous or heretical. Now, he has vanished, leaving behind a legacy of profound knowledge and a trail of unsettling questions, suggesting his curiosity finally led him too deep into the Phantasmal unknown.

**Lore & Motivations:**

*   **Aurosian Foundation, Phantasmal Fascination:** Theronius firmly believed that understanding the totality of existence, including the chaotic whispers of Phantasma and the nature of the Veil, was essential to truly grasping Aurosian truth. He wasn't a worshipper of Phantasma, but a scholar who felt its influence couldn't be ignored or purely demonized if true stability was to be achieved. He might have believed that understanding the "enemy" or the "other" was key to ultimate Aurosian clarity.
*   **The Weight of Knowledge:** As he aged, Theronius likely uncovered truths about Theronian history, the Veil, or perhaps the interplay between Auros and Phantasma that were dangerous. He might have sought to protect this knowledge, or perhaps he was on the verge of a revelation so profound it threatened established powers or cosmic balances.
*   **Overly Curious Nature:** His disappearance is almost certainly linked to him pushing too far. Did he attempt a risky ritual to pierce the Veil? Did he uncover a secret that a hidden faction (perhaps one deeply tied to Phantasmal powers, or even a strict Aurosian sect fearing his research) wanted suppressed? Was he lured or tricked by a Phantasmal entity promising forbidden knowledge?
*   **Legacy for the Players:** Theronius likely served as a mentor, guide, or source of crucial information for the player characters. His notes, research, or even spectral echoes might be key to their current quests. His disappearance provides a strong personal motivation for the players to investigate, not just for his sake, but for the truths he might have taken with him.

**Invocation (How the Players/GM Can Use This Aspect):**

*   **Accessing His Knowledge (Indirectly):** When players consult Theronius's notes, recall his teachings, or visit places he frequented. (e.g., "Because Theronius was a *Missing Mentor of Forbidden Truths*, his hidden journal details the very ritual we need.")
*   **Understanding His Enemies/Allies:** When dealing with factions or entities Theronius interacted with, his reputation or past actions could open doors or create hostility. (e.g., "The Aurosian Council distrusts us because of our association with the *Missing Mentor of Forbidden Truths* and his unorthodox methods.")
*   **Predicting His Actions (If Alive/Contactable):** If there's a chance he's alive or his spirit can be contacted, understanding his dual nature helps predict his choices. (e.g., "Knowing Theronius is a *Missing Mentor of Forbidden Truths*, he'd likely be drawn to the Phantasmal anomaly, despite the danger, seeking answers.")
*   **Highlighting the Dangers of Unchecked Curiosity:** His story serves as a constant reminder of the perils of delving too deep into the mysteries of Umbraxis.

**Compel (How the GM Can Introduce Complications):**

*   **Dangerous Legacy:** Theronius's research or former associates could be dangerous, drawing unwanted attention to the players. (e.g., "Your connection to the *Missing Mentor of Forbidden Truths* means his old Phantasmal contacts now see you as inheritors of his debts.")
*   **Misinterpreted Clues:** His fascination with the Veil might mean his notes are tinged with Phantasmal influence, leading to misinterpretations or traps. (e.g., "The *Missing Mentor of Forbidden Truths*'s notes on the Veil seem clear, but his curiosity led him to record an illusion as fact, leading you astray.")
*   **The Truth is Too Much:** The truths Theronius was chasing might be unsettling or dangerous for the players to uncover themselves, mirroring his own fate. (e.g., "Following the path of the *Missing Mentor of Forbidden Truths* reveals a reality-shattering secret about the Veil that strains your sanity.")
*   **Unforeseen Consequences of His Disappearance:** His absence might have destabilized something he was secretly maintaining or protecting. (e.g., "Because the *Missing Mentor of Forbidden Truths* is gone, the Aurosian ward he secretly maintained on the old library is now failing, unleashing chaotic energies.")
*   **Is He a Victim or Something Else?:** His deep dive into Phantasmal mysteries could mean his disappearance wasn't just a simple kidnapping or accident; he might have been transformed, corrupted, or willingly crossed over. (e.g., "The clues suggest the *Missing Mentor of Forbidden Truths* wasn't taken; he sought to *become* part of the Veil's mystery.")
