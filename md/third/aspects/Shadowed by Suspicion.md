## Aspect: Shadowed by Suspicion

**Name:** Shadowed by Suspicion

**Description:**
This character lives under a constant, self-imposed veil of secrecy, their true past and potentially controversial elements of their identity hidden due to the pervasive paranoia that grips Umbraxan society. Whether their secret involves forbidden knowledge, a connection to a distrusted faction, a "tainted" lineage, or past actions that would be wildly misinterpreted in the current climate of fear, they are adept at deflection, misdirection, and maintaining a carefully constructed persona. This vigilance, however, comes at the cost of genuine connection and the constant fear of exposure.

**Lore & Motivations:**

*   **The Nature of the Secret:** The core of this aspect is the hidden truth. Examples fitting Umbraxis could be:
    *   **A Past Tie to a Phantasmal Cult:** Perhaps they were once involved, willingly or unwillingly, with a group that delved too deep into Phantasmal energies, now viewed with extreme prejudice.
    *   **Unorthodox Magical Practices:** They might possess or practice a form of Veilweaving or Spirit-Sense that is considered heretical or dangerous by the mainstream.
    *   **A "Compromised" Lineage:** They could be distantly related to a figure or group historically blamed for a past catastrophe or associated with a dangerous entity from the Spirit World.
    *   **Witness to a Forbidden Truth:** They might have stumbled upon knowledge that society (or powerful factions within it) actively suppresses, making them a walking liability.
    *   **Survivor of a "Shunned" Event:** They might be one of the few survivors of an event that society prefers to forget or has branded as taboo, making their very existence a uncomfortable reminder.
*   **Constant Vigilance:** The character is always on guard, watchful for any sign that their secret might be unraveling. This makes them perceptive but also potentially jumpy or overly cautious.
*   **Master of Misdirection:** Years of hiding have made them skilled in changing the subject, offering half-truths, or subtly redirecting scrutiny. This might manifest as a talent for `Deceive` or `Stealth` in social situations.
*   **Yearning for Trust, Fear of Betrayal:** Deep down, they may crave genuine connection and trust, but the societal paranoia and the personal risk of their secret being revealed make this incredibly difficult. They are likely to test others extensively before revealing even small parts of themselves.
*   **The Weight of the Mask:** Maintaining their fabricated persona is exhausting. They might have moments of quiet frustration or melancholy when they are alone and can drop the act.

**Invocation (How the Player Can Use This Aspect):**

*   **Avoiding Scrutiny:** When trying to deflect unwanted questions, blend into a crowd, or prevent someone from digging too deeply into their past. (e.g., "Because I am *Shadowed by Suspicion*, I know how to make myself inconspicuous when the city guard starts asking questions.")
*   **Maintaining a False Persona:** When using `Deceive` or social skills to present their carefully constructed identity. (e.g., "My life has been about maintaining this facade; I am *Shadowed by Suspicion*, so of course, they believe I'''m just a simple merchant.")
*   **Detecting Suspicion in Others:** Their own paranoia can make them adept at noticing when others are suspicious of *them*. (e.g., "As someone constantly *Shadowed by Suspicion*, I recognize that look in her eyes; she doesn'''t trust me.")
*   **Knowing Secret Ways/Contacts:** Their need to hide might have led them to discover hidden routes, discreet meeting places, or individuals who operate outside the normal, suspicious eyes of society. (e.g., "Being *Shadowed by Suspicion* means I know a few back alleys and contacts who don'''t ask too many questions.")

**Compel (How the GM Can Introduce Complications):**

*   **The Past Catches Up:** An NPC, object, or piece of information directly related to their hidden past appears, threatening their carefully constructed secrecy. (e.g., "Just as you think you'''re safe, someone from your old life recognizes you, because you are *Shadowed by Suspicion*, and your past is never truly buried.")
*   **Paranoia Breeds Misjudgment:** Their own hyper-vigilance causes them to misinterpret an innocent action or comment as a threat to their secret, leading to an overreaction or a missed opportunity. (e.g., "Your nature as *Shadowed by Suspicion* convinces you this kind stranger is actually a spy, and you push them away, losing a potential ally.")
*   **Sacrificing Opportunities for Secrecy:** They might have to forgo a valuable opportunity, refuse to help someone, or make a difficult choice to protect their secret, even if it goes against their better judgment. (e.g., "You know you could help them with your forbidden knowledge, but because you are *Shadowed by Suspicion*, you remain silent to protect your secret, and the situation worsens.")
*   **Accused Unjustly (or Justly!):** In a society rife with distrust (`Widespread Distrust` situational aspect), their secretive nature makes them an easy target for accusations, whether they are guilty of what they are accused of or not. (e.g., "When something goes wrong, all eyes turn to the quiet, secretive one. As you are *Shadowed by Suspicion*, you'''re the prime suspect.")
*   **The Mask Slips:** Stress, an unexpected emotional trigger, or a moment of carelessness causes a piece of their true self or past to peek through, raising suspicion. (e.g., "In your anger, you blurt out a phrase in a dialect only spoken by the group you'''re hiding from. Your mask slips because you are *Shadowed by Suspicion*.")
