## Trouble Aspect: Tethered to the Echo

**Name:** Tethered to the Echo

**Type:** Trouble Aspect

**Description:**
You are haunted by a persistent spiritual entity, an "Echo" from the spirit world that has become tethered to your soul. This isn't a mere fleeting haunting; the spirit is a constant presence, its needs, emotions, and sometimes its very manifestation bleeding into your life, often at the most inconvenient or dangerous times. While it might occasionally offer cryptic insights or warnings, its presence is predominantly a source of complications, drawing unwanted attention from other spirits, interfering with your actions, and affecting your interactions with the physical world.

**Lore & Motivations of the Spirit (Examples - choose or adapt one, or let the player define it):**

*   **A Lost Soul Seeking Passage:** The spirit is confused and lost, perhaps a victim of "The Bleeding Veil" or another event that trapped it. It clings to you, hoping you can guide it to its final rest, but its fear and confusion often manifest as disruptive paranormal activity.
*   **A Guardian with Unclear Intent:** The Echo might believe it's protecting you, but its methods are archaic, misunderstood, or simply incompatible with mortal life. Its "protection" could involve lashing out at perceived threats (even friends) or trying to drag you away from danger, literally or figuratively.
*   **A "Shifting Phantom" Tormentor:** Aligned with Lyra's more malevolent aspects, this spirit delights in causing chaos, fear, and confusion. It might whisper misleading information, manipulate your senses, or try to isolate you from your allies.
*   **A Spirit with Unfinished Business:** The Echo is tied to a specific task, object, or location and believes you are key to resolving its earthly ties. Its attempts to communicate or force your cooperation are disruptive and draining.
*   **An Ancestral Echo:** The spirit is an ancestor, perhaps a "Spirit-Bound" individual from your lineage, whose connection to you is strong. They might offer cryptic advice or warnings but also impose old obligations or draw you into ancient family feuds or spiritual pacts.

**Invocation (How the Player Can Use This Aspect - usually for a compelled benefit):**

*While Trouble Aspects are primarily for GM compels, a player might occasionally invoke their Trouble if it leads to an interesting, albeit complicated, outcome that *could* be beneficial in a roundabout way. This is rare for Trouble Aspects.*

*   **Cryptic Warning:** "Because I am *Tethered to the Echo*, the spirit suddenly shows me a fleeting, terrifying vision of the trap ahead, giving me just enough warning to hesitate." (GM might offer a Fate Point to accept a complication related to the vision's disturbing nature or the attention it draws).
*   **Unintentional Intimidation:** "My *Tethered Echo* manifests in a disturbing way, its chilling presence unsettling the guards more than my words ever could." (Complication: the guards are now terrified and unpredictable, or call for spiritual aid).

**Compel (How the GM Can Introduce Complications):**

*   **Sudden Manifestation:** "Because you are *Tethered to the Echo*, just as you're trying to sneak past the cultists, the spirit manifests visibly (or audibly), drawing their immediate attention to you."
*   **Emotional Bleed-Through:** "The despair of your *Tethered Echo* overwhelms you at this crucial moment of negotiation. Because of this, you falter, your words choked with an sorrow that isn't entirely your own, undermining your position."
*   **Spiritual Interference:** "As you attempt to cast a delicate "Golden Resonance" spell, your *Tethered Echo* surges, its chaotic Lyran energy interfering with the Aethelian magic, causing the spell to fizzle or have an unintended, troublesome side effect."
*   **Attracting Unwanted Attention:** "Your *Tethered Echo*'s presence acts like a beacon in the spirit world. Because of this, a far more dangerous entity (perhaps a Soul-Eater or a Shifting Phantom) notices its signature and is now drawn towards you."
*   **Misinterpreted Signals:** "The *Tethered Echo* tries to warn you of danger by rattling objects, but because of its constant, disruptive presence, your companions misinterpret it as just another haunting episode and ignore the crucial, albeit clumsy, warning."
*   **Physical Hindrance:** "Because you are *Tethered to the Echo*, the spirit physically jostles you or clouds your vision at a critical moment, causing you to stumble during a chase or miss a vital clue."
*   **Possession Attempt (Major Compel):** "The influence of Lyra is strong here, and your *Tethered Echo* sees an opportunity. It attempts to assert greater control, compelling you to act against your will or fight for dominance of your own body."
*   **Social Awkwardness/Fear:** "People sensitive to the spirit world, or even just animals, react poorly to your *Tethered Echo*. Because of this, the usually friendly merchant becomes fearful and refuses to deal with you, or the guard dog barks incessantly, raising an alarm."
