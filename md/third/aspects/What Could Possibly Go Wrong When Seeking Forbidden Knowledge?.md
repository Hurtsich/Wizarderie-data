## Trouble Aspect: What Could Possibly Go Wrong When Seeking Forbidden Knowledge?

**Character:** Theronius Lumian

**Description:**
Theronius Lumian's thirst for knowledge is a double-edged sword. While it drives his groundbreaking discoveries in Theronian history, artifacts, and the nature of the Veil, it also makes him a magnet for trouble. He is often so engrossed in deciphering an ancient text, examining a curious artifact, or puzzling out an arcane phenomenon that he fails to notice the collapsing ceiling above, the suspicious glint in a "helpful" stranger's eyes, or the cultists chanting in the next room. His pursuit of understanding frequently leads him to disregard warnings, underestimate dangers, and inadvertently stumble into perilous situations or onto information that powerful groups would rather remained buried.

**Invocation (Examples):**

*   **By the GM:**
    *   When Theronius is about to enter a clearly dangerous ruin without taking precautions because he's spotted an unusual glyph. "Theronius, your desire to inspect that fascinating inscription up close means you fail to notice the crumbling ledge you're stepping on. *What Could Possibly Go Wrong When Seeking Forbidden Knowledge?*" (Compel: He stumbles, attracting attention or taking minor damage).
    *   When Theronius eagerly accepts a "rare manuscript" from a shady informant without questioning their motives. "This script could be the key to understanding the Veil, Theronius! You're so excited you barely register the sly smile on the informant's face as he takes your coin. *What Could Possibly Go Wrong When Seeking Forbidden Knowledge?*" (Compel: The manuscript is a trap, cursed, or leads to an ambush).
    *   When a critical piece of information needs to be overlooked by Theronius to increase tension or allow a villain's plan to advance. "Theronius, you're so focused on the celestial alignment described in the prophecy that you dismiss the guard's warnings about increased Veiled Hand activity in the area as mere superstition. *What Could Possibly Go Wrong When Seeking Forbidden Knowledge?*" (Compel: The Veiled Hand strikes while he's unprepared).

*   **By the Player (Theronius):**
    *   To deliberately enter a risky situation for the sake of knowledge. "I know this library is forbidden and guarded by ancient wards, but those scrolls might explain the origin of the Bleed! *What Could Possibly Go Wrong When Seeking Forbidden Knowledge?* I'm going in." (Gain a Fate Point, complication ensues).
    *   To justify ignoring obvious social cues or warnings due to academic focus. "Lady Aris is clearly trying to distract me with pleasantries, but this artifact she 'found' is far too important! I must examine it now, even if it's rude. *What Could Possibly Go Wrong When Seeking Forbidden Knowledge?*" (Gain a Fate Point, social faux pas leads to trouble).
    *   To explain a critical oversight that complicates matters for the party. "I was so certain the ritual markings were purely ceremonial, I didn't think to check if they were also part of a summoning circle... *What Could Possibly Go Wrong When Seeking Forbidden Knowledge?*" (Gain a Fate Point, a creature is summoned).

**Potential Complications Arising from this Trouble:**

*   Accidentally activating dangerous artifacts or traps.
*   Walking into ambushes or hostile territory unprepared.
*   Trusting untrustworthy individuals who offer knowledge.
*   Losing valuable items (or party members!) while distracted by a discovery.
*   Unwittingly revealing sensitive information to the wrong people.
*   Becoming a target for those who wish to exploit his knowledge or silence him.
*   Causing diplomatic incidents by focusing on research over protocol.
