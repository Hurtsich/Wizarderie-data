# The Sleepy Dragon Tavern

**Proprietor:** Pipkin Shortwick (Halfling)

**Location:** Within Aethelgard or a nearby settlement (as per GM's discretion, suggested by "The Tavern of Lost Echoes" quest). Given the details in the "Artisan's Rest District (Aethelgard)" and "A Lingering Haze" quest, placing it in or near Aethelgard, perhaps even on the fringes of a district like the Artisan's Rest, could create interesting tie-ins.

**Overall Description:**
The Sleepy Dragon was once a beacon of warmth and cheer, renowned for its comforting atmosphere, Pipkin's hearty stews, and the general good humor of its patrons. It’s a modestly sized, two-story timber and stone building. The sign outside depicts a rather plump, green dragon curled up asleep in front of a hearth, smoke gently curling from its nostrils. Lately, however, a palpable chill has descended upon the tavern. The usual boisterous laughter has been replaced by nervous whispers, and the warm lighting seems dimmer, less able to push back the encroaching shadows in the corners. Dust motes dance in the air, sometimes swirling in unnatural patterns, and a persistent, faint odor of old parchment and something vaguely metallic (like cold iron) lingers.

## Layout:

**1. Ground Floor:**

*   **Common Room:**
    *   **Description:** The largest area of the tavern. A long, scarred wooden bar runs along one wall, stocked with a dwindling supply of ales, wines, and spirits. Several sturdy wooden tables and chairs are scattered throughout, though many now sit empty. A large stone hearth, usually crackling with a welcoming fire, is now often cold or burns with a weak, sputtering flame that gives off little heat. The floorboards are well-worn, and in some places, a loose board might hide a lost coin or a forgotten trinket.
    *   **Features:**
        *   **The Bar:** Tankards and bottles here are known to rattle without cause or even slide slowly across the polished wood. Pipkin often finds them rearranged in the morning.
        *   **Patron's Corner:** A previously popular nook with a comfortable, high-backed chair. Patrons who sat here recently have reported feeling icy breath on their necks or the unsettling sensation of someone looking over their shoulder. This was the favorite spot of a long-departed regular, a quiet scholar named Elara Meadowlight (a potential red herring or link to Lyra Meadowlight from the Artisan's Rest, if desired by the GM).
        *   **Hearth:** The fire here struggles to stay lit. Sometimes, faint whispers seem to emanate from the crackling flames, too indistinct to understand but clearly present. Soot patterns on the chimney breast sometimes resemble fleeting, sorrowful faces.
        *   **Decorations:** Old maps of the local area and a few faded tapestries depicting local legends adorn the walls. These tapestries have been seen to ripple as if a breeze passed over them, even in a sealed room.

*   **Kitchen:**
    *   **Description:** Located behind the bar, this is Pipkin’s domain. It’s usually a place of bustling activity and savory smells. Now, it’s eerily quiet.
    *   **Features:**
        *   **Pots and Pans:** Cutlery and cookware have been heard clattering in the dead of night. Cupboard doors are frequently found ajar, even after being securely closed. The cook (if Pipkin still has one) might report hearing their name called when alone.
        *   **Cold Spot:** A persistent cold spot exists near the pantry door, regardless of how hot the ovens are. Food stored here seems to spoil quicker than usual.

*   **Cellar Access:**
    *   **Description:** A heavy wooden door, usually locked, leads down to the cellars.
    *   **Features:** Strange scratching sounds are sometimes heard from behind the door. Staff are particularly reluctant to go down here.

**2. Cellar:**

*   **Description:** A cool, damp space used for storing ale barrels, wine casks, and preserved foods. It’s low-ceilinged and lit by a few sputtering oil lamps (if anyone dares to light them).
*   **Features:**
    *   **Whispering Barrels:** Some claim to hear hushed, mournful whispers originating from the darker corners, particularly around older, forgotten casks.
    *   **Moving Objects:** Barrels have been found rolled out of position, and crates stacked precariously as if about to topple.
    *   **The Lost Memento:** A specific area, perhaps beneath a loose flagstone or tucked away in a forgotten alcove, could be the resting place of an object connected to a past tragedy or a former inhabitant. This might be a child's lost toy, a soldier's tarnished medal, a lover's faded letter.

**3. Upper Floor:**

*   **Pipkin's Quarters:**
    *   **Description:** A modest set of rooms for Pipkin himself. He reports disturbed sleep, nightmares, and the feeling of being watched.
    *   **Features:** Personal items might be moved, or a window might be found open when it was securely latched.

*   **Guest Rooms (Few):**
    *   **Description:** The Sleepy Dragon has a few small, simple rooms for weary travelers. These are rarely used now.
    *   **Features:** Guests who have braved a stay report cold spots, doors creaking open, and the sound of soft footsteps in the hallway when no one is there. Objects left on nightstands might be found on the floor.

## Eerie Phenomena (as per "The Tavern of Lost Echoes"):

The hauntings are generally minor but pervasive and deeply unsettling:

*   **Auditory:**
    *   **Whispers:** Faint, indistinct whispers heard when no one is speaking, sometimes seeming to call names or sigh. These are more common in the Common Room hearth, the Kitchen, and the Cellar.
    *   **Moving Objects:** The clatter of unseen objects falling, tankards sliding, cupboard doors banging open or shut, bottles rattling on shelves.
    *   **Footsteps:** Soft, unseen footsteps heard on the floorboards above or in empty hallways.
    *   **Scratching:** Faint scratching sounds from within walls or from behind the cellar door.
*   **Visual:**
    *   **Moving Shadows:** Shadows in the corners of rooms seem to stretch or deepen unnaturally.
    *   **Fleeting Shapes:** Guests and staff report catching fleeting glimpses of movement out of the corner of their eyes.
    *   **Rearranged Objects:** Small items (cutlery, books, decorative trinkets) are often found moved from where they were left, sometimes arranged in peculiar (but not overtly symbolic) patterns.
*   **Tactile/Sensory:**
    *   **Cold Spots:** Localized areas that are inexplicably colder than their surroundings, particularly near the kitchen pantry and in the "Patron's Corner."
    *   **Sensation of Being Watched:** A common complaint from Pipkin, his staff, and the few remaining patrons.
    *   **Unseen Touch:** Rare instances of feeling a cold breath on the neck or a light, cobweb-like touch on the arm or hair.
    *   **Faint Odors:** Besides the persistent metallic/old parchment smell, occasional whiffs of a forgotten perfume or a sudden smell of dust and decay in otherwise clean areas.

## Lore & Motivations for Players:

*   **Pipkin Shortwick's Plight:** The primary motivation is to help the distraught Pipkin. He’s losing his livelihood, his beloved tavern is becoming a place of fear, and his jovial spirit is being crushed. He offers what he can in return for aid (room, board, information, perhaps a unique recipe like "Pipkin's Courage Brew").
*   **The Nature of the Haunting:** As per "The Tavern of Lost Echoes," players need to determine the cause:
    *   **A Lingering Echo:** Is it a confused or lonely spirit tied to a past event or patron? Perhaps Elara Meadowlight, or someone whose memento lies hidden in the cellar? The goal would be to understand its needs and help it find peace.
    *   **A Bleed-Touched Object:** Has an item, perhaps recently acquired by Pipkin (e.g., from a peddler, or found in a dusty crate), become a minor Bleed-focus, subtly warping reality? This ties into the broader themes of the Veil Ascendant and the Artisan's Rest district.
    *   **Mundane Sabotage:** Could a rival tavern owner or a disgruntled former employee be using trickery to scare Pipkin out of business?
*   **Investigative Opportunities:** The tavern is rich with opportunities for Perception, Investigation, and Insight checks. Interviewing Pipkin, staff, and former patrons is key. A thorough search of the premises, especially the cellar and the "Patron's Corner," might yield vital clues. A stakeout could allow players to witness phenomena firsthand.
*   **Connection to Aethelgard's Troubles:** If the tavern is near the Artisan's Rest, the phenomena might be a localized symptom of the wider issues affecting that district, perhaps even an overspill of the Haze Weavers' activities or a similar, independent Bleed effect.

## Options for Players:

*   **Investigate:** Conduct interviews, search for clues, and identify patterns in the disturbances.
*   **Observe:** Spend a night in the tavern to witness the phenomena directly.
*   **Interact/Pacify:** If an Echo is discovered, attempt to communicate or appease it.
*   **Cleanse/Remove:** If a Bleed-touched object is found, decide how to deal with it (cleanse, contain, or deliver to experts).
*   **Expose:** If mundane sabotage is suspected, gather proof and confront the culprit.
*   **Roleplay:** Interact with Pipkin, offering comfort or strategic advice.

This detailed location provides a rich environment for the "The Tavern of Lost Echoes" side quest, offering multiple avenues for investigation and resolution, and can be easily integrated into the broader events occurring in Aethelgard.
