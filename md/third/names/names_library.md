The world of Aethel and Lyra, bound by the twin suns – Aethel the Golden, and Lyra the Pale, the Ghost Sun – is a place of shifting realities and profound spiritual influence. As Lyra ascends, the veil between worlds thins, magic becomes fluid, and the echoes of the spirit world bleed into the mundane. This duality shapes every aspect of life, from the names people bear to the lands they inhabit and the factions they align with.

Herein lies a compendium of names, crafted to reflect the golden stability of Aethel, the ethereal mystery of Lyra, and the unsettling paranoia their combined dance inspires.
