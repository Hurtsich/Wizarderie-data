# Side Quest: The Tavern of Lost Echoes

**Arc:** 1 - The Whispers of Unreality

**Quest Type:** Side Quest

**Theme:** Supernatural investigation, social interaction, minor hauntings.

**Quest Giver:** Pipkin Shortwick, owner of "The Sleepy Dragon" tavern.

**Premise:**
"The Sleepy Dragon" tavern, usually a bustling and cheerful establishment in [Name of Town/District - *GM to specify, could be in Aethelgard or a nearby settlement*], has fallen under a strange pall. Objects clatter and move on their own, eerie whispers are heard when no one is speaking, and patrons report unsettling sensations of being watched or even touched by unseen hands. The proprietor, a usually jovial and pragmatic halfling named Pipkin Shortwick, is distraught. Business has plummeted, his staff are spooked, and he fears he may have to close the beloved tavern if the source of the disturbances isn't found and dealt with.

**Goal:**
The players are asked to investigate the strange phenomena at "The Sleepy Dragon" tavern. They need to determine the cause of the hauntings:
*   Is it a mischievous but relatively harmless Echo, perhaps tied to a past event or patron of the tavern?
*   Are the events caused by a Bleed-touched object hidden somewhere within the tavern, subtly warping reality?
*   Or is a more mundane explanation at play – could a rival business be using trickery and scare tactics to drive Pipkin out of business?

**Progression & Potential Challenges:**

1.  **Anxious Pipkin:**
    *   The players might hear rumors of the tavern's troubles or be approached directly by a worried Pipkin Shortwick. He'll recount the events, emphasizing his fear of losing his livelihood and the community hub he’s built. He's willing to offer what he can in return for help.
    *   Pipkin can describe specific incidents: tankards sliding off tables, cupboard doors banging open, hushed voices when only one person is in a room, and specific patrons who’ve been scared off.

2.  **Whispers and Witnesses (Social Interaction, Insight, Perception):**
    *   Players should interview Pipkin, his remaining staff (if any are brave enough to still work), and any former patrons they can find.
    *   **Staff:** Might include a nervous cook who heard their name called, a barmaid who saw bottles rattle, or a stablehand who refuses to go into the cellar anymore.
    *   **Patrons:** Some might exaggerate, others might offer genuine, unsettling accounts. Are there common themes in their experiences?
    *   **Challenges:** Discerning genuine fear from embellishment, calming panicked individuals to get clear information, and noticing subtle details in their stories.

3.  **The Scene of the Strange (Investigation, Perception):**
    *   Players will need to conduct a thorough search of "The Sleepy Dragon." This includes the common room, kitchen, cellars, and any private rooms.
    *   **Clues to look for:**
        *   Unusual cold spots.
        *   Faint, unidentifiable odors (ozone, dust, a forgotten perfume).
        *   Objects that seem out of place or have fallen in ways that defy simple explanations.
        *   Any strange symbols or markings (though unlikely for a simple Echo or mundane sabotage).
        *   The source of the whispers – do they seem to originate from a specific area?

4.  **Stakeout (Stealth, Perception, Will):**
    *   Pipkin might agree to let the players stay in the tavern overnight to observe the phenomena firsthand.
    *   **Challenges:** Staying alert, resisting fear or unease caused by the atmosphere, and potentially witnessing events directly. This is a good opportunity for minor, spooky occurrences: a door creaking open, a chair rocking, whispers that seem to respond to their presence.

5.  **Identifying the Source - Potential Paths:**

    *   **Path A: The Lingering Echo:**
        *   **Discovery:** The investigation might reveal that the disturbances are strongest around a particular object or area – perhaps an old forgotten portrait, a loose floorboard hiding a lost memento, or the favorite chair of a long-departed regular. The Echo could be confused, playful, or simply lonely, not intending true harm but causing distress.
        *   **Interaction:** Players might try to communicate with the Echo (if it's intelligent enough), understand its connection to the tavern, and help it find peace or move on. This could involve finding a lost item, fulfilling a forgotten request, or simply acknowledging its presence respectfully.
        *   **Lore/Occult Check:** To understand the nature of Echoes and how to pacify them.

    *   **Path B: The Bleed-Touched Focus:**
        *   **Discovery:** The search uncovers an unassuming item (e.g., an old coin, a tarnished locket, a strangely carved tankard Pipkin bought from a peddler) that emanates a faint, unsettling energy (Perception with Arcane affinity, or specific spells). This object is a minor Bleed-focus, unintentionally amplifying the local Bleed effects and causing the strange occurrences. It might have been recently introduced to the tavern.
        *   **Resolution:** Removing the object carefully and either cleansing it (if possible and known how), containing it, or handing it over to someone who can deal with such items (like an Auroran Priest or an Argent Warden if the players have such contacts).
        *   **Investigation/Lore Check:** To identify the properties of Bleed-touched items.

    *   **Path C: Mundane Sabotage:**
        *   **Discovery:** Careful observation or investigation reveals signs of trickery: hidden strings, small mechanisms, evidence of someone sneaking around after hours. Perhaps a disgruntled former employee or a rival tavern owner is trying to ruin Pipkin.
        *   **Resolution:** Gathering proof of the sabotage and confronting the culprit. This could lead to a social confrontation, a chase, or even a minor scuffle.
        *   **Insight/Investigation Check:** To see through deception or spot cleverly hidden devices.

**Rewards:**

*   **Pipkin's Gratitude:** Regardless of the cause, resolving the disturbances will earn the immense gratitude of Pipkin Shortwick.
    *   He might offer free room and board at "The Sleepy Dragon" for a set period.
    *   He could share a unique tavern recipe (e.g., "Pipkin's Courage Brew" or "Shortwick's Savory Stew") that, when consumed, grants a minor, temporary buff (e.g., +1 to Will saves for an hour, or temporary hit points).
    *   A piece of local information or a connection he might have.
*   **Insight into the Veil Ascendant:** The quest provides a glimpse into the more subtle, less overtly hostile, or perplexing aspects of the thinned Veil – be it lost Echoes or the quiet influence of Bleed-touched items. If it's sabotage, it's a reminder that not all strange things are supernatural.
*   **Reputation:** Increased standing in the local community as helpful investigators capable of solving unusual problems.
*   **Monetary/Material Reward:** A modest sum of gold from Pipkin, or perhaps a useful common item he offers from his personal belongings.

**Outcomes:**

*   **Success:** The source of the disturbances is identified and resolved. "The Sleepy Dragon" returns to normal, Pipkin is overjoyed, and the players receive their rewards and some interesting insights.
*   **Partial Success:** The players might mitigate the phenomena (e.g., temporarily calm an Echo, or identify a saboteur who then escapes) but not fully resolve it. Pipkin is thankful but still worried. Rewards might be reduced.
*   **Complication:** If an Echo is mishandled, it might become more agitated. If a Bleed-touched item is improperly handled, it could have minor negative effects on the carrier. If saboteurs are involved, they might seek revenge.

**Connection to Arc:**
This side quest subtly reinforces the themes of Arc 1: "The Whispers of Unreality" by:
*   Showcasing localized, low-level supernatural phenomena.
*   Introducing players to Echoes or Bleed-touched objects in a less combat-focused scenario.
*   Providing a social investigation that relies on different skills.
*   Highlighting how the thinned Veil can affect everyday life and ordinary people.
