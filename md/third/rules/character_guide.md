# Umbraxis: The Sundered Veil - Character Creation Guide

Welcome, awakened soul, to Umbraxis, a world sculpted by the eternal dance of two suns: Auros, the golden arbiter of truth and stability, and Phantasma, the pale weaver of illusions and mutable reality. Here, the very fabric of existence shifts and strains, and the Spirit World bleeds into our own, whispering secrets and weaving nightmares.

Creating your character in Umbraxis is more than just assigning numbers to a sheet; it's about defining who you are in this wondrous and terrifying duality. Will you be a beacon of clarity, striving to uphold truth in a world prone to deception? Or will you embrace the mutable nature of reality, bending illusions to your will and navigating the whispers of the unseen? Your choices will forge your destiny and shape the very Veil itself.

Let's begin the journey of awakening your character.

## 1. Defining Your Core: Aspects - Threads of Truth & Illusion

Aspects are the heart of your character. They are concise phrases that encapsulate your core beliefs, significant truths, potent illusions, and defining relationships or complications. In Umbraxis, your Aspects aren't just descriptions; they are fundamental truths or powerful illusions that *influence reality around you*. They tell us what's important to your character and what makes them unique.

You will typically start with **five Aspects**:

*   **High Concept:** This is your character's essence, their role in the world, and their primary identifier. It should be evocative and contain both an advantage and a potential vulnerability. Think about how your character navigates the duality of Auros and Phantasma, or their connection to the Spirit World.
*   **Trouble:** This Aspect is your character's recurring problem, their Achilles' heel, or the complication that inevitably draws them into difficult situations. It's how the GM offers you Fate Points! This should directly relate to the campaign's themes of mutable reality, spiritual influence, or societal paranoia.
*   **Three Free Aspects:** These can be anything that further defines your character â€“ a significant past event, a defining belief, a crucial relationship, a prized possession, or a secret.

**What Makes a Good Aspect in Umbraxis?**

*   **Active and Evocative:** It should hint at action and personality. Instead of "I'm smart," try "A Mind Like a Steel Trap."
*   **Double-Edged:** Good Aspects can be both helpful (invoked for a bonus) and problematic (compelled for a Fate Point). They open up story possibilities.
*   **Rooted in Umbraxis:** Does it reflect the influence of Auros or Phantasma? Does it touch on the Spirit World, Veil Sickness, or the pervasive societal paranoia? The more it connects to the unique world, the more flavorful and useful it will be.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `Touched by the Phantasma Shroud` (A deep connection to illusion, potentially with drawbacks)
    *   `Seeker of Aurosian Clarity` (Driven by truth and order)
    *   `Haunted by a Spirit Echo` (A lingering spiritual tie)
    *   `My Word is My Bond` (A deep sense of honor, perhaps rigid in a shifting world)
    *   `Driven by a Secret Debt` (A personal complication)
    *   `Cracks in Reality's Facade` (Trouble: Suffering from Veil Sickness and paranoia)

**Example Aspects from Umbraxis:**

Here are some examples to inspire your character's Aspects, reflecting the duality and dangers of Umbraxis:

*   **High Concepts:**
    *   **Seeker of Aurosian Clarity:** Dedicated to truth and stability, unraveling deceptions.
    *   **Echo in the Shroud:** A rogue who thrives in illusion and deception, using the mutable reality to their advantage.
*   **Trouble Aspects:**
    *   **Tethered to the Echo:** Haunted by a specific spirit, which can lead to complications or revelations.
    *   **Cracks in Reality's Facade:** Suffering from Veil Sickness, making it hard to distinguish truth from illusion.
*   **Other Aspects:**
    *   **Veil Piercer:** Possesses an uncanny ability to see through deceptions and illusions.
    *   **Dream-Dancer in Phantasma's Web:** Easily lost in illusions, but finds strength and insight within them.
    *   **Shadowed by Suspicion:** Possesses a hidden past or secret that makes them wary and distrusted by others due to pervasive paranoia.
    *   **Aethel's Beacon:** Possesses a strong, benevolent spiritual connection, often guiding others towards truth and stability.
    *   **Echoes of a Fractured Saint:** Possesses a powerful, but troublesome, spiritual connection that might stem from a past trauma or a compromised entity.

## 2. Honing Your Talents: Skills - Disciplines of the Awakened

Skills represent your character's trained abilities, innate talents, and honed disciplines for navigating the intricate realities of Umbraxis. Whether you're clashing with spectral entities, deciphering ancient prophecies, or charming a wary populace, your skills determine your effectiveness.

In Umbraxis, you'll distribute your skill points in a pyramid:
*   One skill at **+4** (your character's primary strength)
*   Two skills at **+3**
*   Three skills at **+2**
*   Four skills at **+1**

**Umbraxis Skill List:**

*   **Physical Prowess:** Athletics, Fight, Physique, Stealth
*   **Mental Fortitude & Perception:** Lore, Investigate, Notice, Will
*   **Social Acumen & Influence:** Deceive, Empathy, Provoke, Rapport, Resources
*   **Specialized Disciplines of Umbraxis:**
    *   **Craft:** Creating or repairing items, specialized knowledge of tools, crafting Veiled components.
    *   **Drive:** Operating vehicles, piloting airships, riding mounts, navigating treacherous terrain.
    *   **Survival:** Tracking, foraging, enduring wilderness conditions, navigating by natural signs.
    *   **Veilweaving:** The primary skill for casting spells, manipulating the Veil, and shaping reality through Aurosian or Phantasmal magic.
    *   **Spirit-Sense:** Interacting with, perceiving, and resisting the influence of the Spirit World and its inhabitants.

**Choosing Your Skills:**

Consider your High Concept and Trouble. What abilities would naturally stem from them?
*   A `Seeker of Aurosian Clarity` might prioritize **Lore**, **Investigate**, and **Veilweaving** (Aurosian intent).
*   An `Echo in the Shroud` might excel at **Deceive**, **Stealth**, and **Veilweaving** (Phantasmal intent).
*   Someone `Haunted by a Spirit Echo` would likely have strong **Spirit-Sense** and **Will**.

**Note on Specialized Skills (Veilweaving & Spirit-Sense):** These two skills are paramount in Umbraxis. While they are distinct, they can sometimes be used to accomplish tasks that *could* otherwise fall under other skills, if the primary challenge is magical or spiritual. For example:
*   You might use **Veilweaving** to `Investigate` a magically-warded room, understanding the arcane energies within.
*   You could use **Spirit-Sense** to `Notice` a hidden message left by a phantom, or to `Overcome` a mental block caused by spiritual interference.
The GM will always help you determine the most appropriate skill based on your character's approach and the nature of the challenge.

## 3. Unlocking Your Potential: Stunts - Echoes of Power

Stunts are unique, specialized abilities or honed techniques that give your character an edge. They represent a significant investment of training, a particular talent, or even a subtle blessing/curse from the Veil itself. Stunts allow you to bend or break the rules in small ways, often enhancing your skills or granting new options.

You begin with **three Stunts**. Each stunt should either:
*   Grant a +2 bonus to a specific skill roll in a narrow circumstance (e.g., "Because I'm a master pickpocket, I get +2 to **Stealth** when lifting objects from a moving target.")
*   Allow you to use one skill in place of another for a specific action (e.g., "Because I'm a veteran negotiator, I can use **Rapport** instead of **Provoke** to intimidate someone by subtly shaming them.")
*   Grant a unique, minor ability (e.g., "Once per session, I can automatically succeed at a Lore roll to recall information about ancient Theronian ruins.").

**Crafting Umbraxis-Themed Stunts:**

Think about how your character's unique connection to the suns, the Veil, or the Spirit World might manifest as special abilities.
*   **Aurosian Stunts:** Focus on clarity, truth, stability, protection, direct force.
    *   *Example:* **Aurosian Insight:** Once per session, you can use **Lore** instead of **Investigate** to discover a fundamental truth, bypassing illusions and distortions.
    *   *Example:* **Shield of Truth:** When you **Defend** against a Phantasmal **Veilweaving** attack, you gain a +2 bonus.
*   **Phantasmal Stunts:** Focus on illusion, deception, sensory manipulation, influence, and mutable reality.
    *   *Example:* **Phantasmal Diversion:** You can use **Deceive** to create an advantage by distracting with a minor, non-magical illusion.
    *   *Example:* **Blurred Form:** When in a `Phantasma Shroud`, you gain a +2 to **Athletics** when dodging.
*   **Spirit-Sense Stunts:** Focus on interacting with spirits, resisting their influence, or using their energies.
    *   *Example:* **Whisper-Reader:** You can use **Spirit-Sense** to **Notice** subtle emotional imprints left by spirits in a location.
    *   *Example:* **Echo-Fortified Will:** Once per session, if you spend a Fate Point to refuse a compel on a Spirit-related Aspect, you also gain a +2 bonus on your next **Will** roll related to that situation.
