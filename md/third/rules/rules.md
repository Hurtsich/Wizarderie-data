# Rules of Umbraxis: The Sundered Veil (Revised)

This ruleset adapts the FATE Core system to the world of Umbraxis, where reality is shaped by the dual influences of Auros (truth, stability) and Phantasma (illusion, change), and the Spirit World constantly brushes against mortal existence.

## The Fabric of Umbraxis: Core Concepts

### Aspects: Threads of Truth & Illusion

Aspects are phrases that define people, places, and situations in Umbraxis. They are not merely descriptions; they are fundamental truths or potent illusions that influence reality.

*   **Character Aspects:** These define who your character is â€“ their core beliefs, skills, personal truths, significant lies, and the marks left upon them by the world. Examples: `Touched by the Phantasma Shroud`, `Seeker of Aurosian Clarity`, `Haunted by a Spirit Echo`, `My Word is My Bond`, `Driven by a Secret Debt`.
*   **Situational & Environmental Aspects:** The world of Umbraxis is rife with aspects. A specific location might have `Aurosian Glyphs of Protection`, a shifting alleyway might be `Warped by Phantasmal Influence`, or an encounter might be `Shrouded in Distrust`.
*   **Invoking an Aspect:** When a truth or illusion described by an Aspect is helpful to your character's action, you can *Invoke* it. This costs a Fate Point and grants you a +2 bonus to your roll or allows you to reroll the dice. The more deeply connected you are to the Aspect, the more potent its invocation.
*   **Compelling an Aspect:** When a truth or illusion described by an Aspect would complicate your character's life or lead them into trouble, the GM can *Compel* it. You can accept the complication and gain a Fate Point, or refuse by spending a Fate Point.

### Skills: Disciplines of the Awakened

Skills represent your character's trained abilities and innate talents in navigating the complex realities of Umbraxis. Each skill relates to specific actions within the world.

*   **Physical Prowess:**
    *   **Athletics:** Running, jumping, climbing, dodging, and physical feats of agility.
    *   **Fight:** Engaging in close-quarters combat, wielding weapons or fists.
    *   **Physique:** Enduring physical strain, resisting poisons, lifting, and tests of raw strength.
    *   **Stealth:** Moving unseen, hiding, and concealing objects.
*   **Mental Fortitude & Perception:**
    *   **Lore:** Knowledge of history, legends, rituals, Arcane secrets, and the nature of the Veil.
    *   **Investigate:** Finding hidden clues, solving mysteries, deduction, and forensic analysis.
    *   **Notice:** Perceiving details, spotting dangers, detecting illusions, and sensing the subtle shifts in reality.
    *   **Will:** Resisting mental influence, enduring torture, maintaining composure, and focusing magical intent.
*   **Social Acumen & Influence:**
    *   **Deceive:** Lying, misdirection, creating convincing non-magical illusions, and disguises.
    *   **Empathy:** Reading people, understanding emotions, detecting lies.
    *   **Provoke:** Intimidating, annoying, or inciting others to action.
    *   **Rapport:** Building trust, charming, persuading, and inspiring others.
    *   **Resources:** Acquiring money, goods, information, or favors through influence and connections.
*   **Specialized Disciplines of Umbraxis:**
    *   **Craft:** Creating or repairing items, specialized knowledge of tools, crafting Veiled components.
    *   **Drive:** Operating vehicles, piloting airships, riding mounts, navigating treacherous terrain.
    *   **Survival:** Tracking, foraging, enduring wilderness conditions, navigating by natural signs.
    *   **Veilweaving:** The primary skill for casting spells, manipulating the Veil, and shaping reality through Aurosian or Phantasmal magic. (See "Weaving the Veil" below).
    *   **Spirit-Sense:** Interacting with, perceiving, and resisting the influence of the Spirit World and its inhabitants. (See "The Spirit World" below).

    *Note on Specialized Skills:* While Veilweaving and Spirit-Sense are distinct, a character might sometimes use them to accomplish tasks that *could* otherwise fall under another skill, if the primary challenge is magical or spiritual. For example, `Veilweaving` might be used to `Investigate` a magically-warded room, or `Spirit-Sense` could `Notice` a hidden message left by a spirit. The GM will decide which skill is most appropriate based on the character's approach and the nature of the challenge.

### Stunts: Echoes of Power

Stunts are unique, specialized abilities or honed techniques that give your character an edge. They represent a significant investment of training, a particular talent, or even a subtle blessing/curse from the Veil itself. Stunts allow you to break or bend the rules in small ways. Examples: `Swift as a Whisper` (gain +2 to Stealth when moving silently), `Aurosian Insight` (once per session, you can use Lore instead of Investigate to discover a fundamental truth, bypassing illusions), `Phantasmal Diversion` (use Deceive to create an advantage by distracting with a minor, non-magical illusion).

### Fate Points: Sparks of Clarity & Madness

Fate Points are a crucial resource, representing your character's ability to push their luck, seize a moment of opportune truth, or exploit a sudden weakness in the Veil. They are spent to:

*   Invoke an Aspect for a bonus or reroll.
*   Activate a Stunt.
*   Refuse a Compel.
*   Declare a Story Detail: Introduce a minor fact into the scene that benefits you (e.g., "I know of a hidden passage through the `Warped Market`").

You gain Fate Points by accepting compels, allowing an Aspect to complicate your life, or at the start of each session.

## Actions & Outcomes: Navigating Reality

All actions in Umbraxis are resolved by rolling 4dF (four Fate dice, which show +, -, or blank) and adding your relevant skill rating. The result is compared against a Difficulty (set by the GM) or an Opponent's roll.

*   **Overcome the Veil (Overcome):** Achieve a goal by bypassing an obstacle, solving a problem, or navigating a challenging situation.
    *   *Examples:* Using `Athletics` to climb a crumbling tower, `Lore` to decipher ancient Aurosian runes, `Survival` to find safe passage through a `Phantasma Shroud`, `Veilweaving` to stabilize a flickering reality.
*   **Shape the Truth (Create Advantage):** Introduce new Aspects into the scene or discover existing ones, making it easier for yourself or allies to act, or harder for opponents.
    *   *Examples:* Using `Provoke` to make an opponent `Enraged`, `Notice` to discover that a room is `Shrouded in Illusion`, `Veilweaving` to create a `Wall of Phantasmal Mist` or `Aurosian Barrier` in combat.
*   **Strike the Veil (Attack):** Inflict stress or consequences on an opponent, whether through physical force, mental assault, or magical power.
    *   *Examples:* Using `Fight` to strike an enemy with a sword, `Provoke` to mentally overwhelm a foe, `Veilweaving` to blast an enemy with a burst of arcane energy.
*   **Endure the Shroud (Defend):** Prevent an opponent from succeeding at their action, whether it's an attack, a challenge, or an attempt to create an advantage against you.
    *   *Examples:* Using `Athletics` to dodge a strike, `Will` to resist a mental compulsion, `Veilweaving` to conjure a defensive ward against a magical attack.

### Contests & Conflicts

*   **Contests:** When multiple characters compete for a single goal, they engage in a Contest. Each character rolls a relevant skill, and the highest successes move forward. Failure means elimination or setback.
*   **Conflicts:** When characters try to hurt or capture one another, it's a Conflict. This involves rounds of actions (Attack, Defend, Create Advantage, Overcome) until one side yields or is taken out.

## Consequences: The Price of Unveiling

When your character takes hits in a conflict (physical, mental, or spiritual) that exceed their Stress capacity, they must take a Consequence. Consequences are temporary Aspects that reflect wounds, trauma, or subtle shifts in reality.

*   **Stress Boxes:** Temporary absorption of minor hits. Once checked, they clear at the end of a round or scene.
*   **Consequences:**
    *   **Minor (2 shifts):** `Sprained Ankle`, `Distracted by Doubt`, `Veil-Sickened`. Clears relatively quickly.
    *   **Moderate (4 shifts):** `Broken Arm`, `Plagued by Illusions`, `Marked by the Spirit World`. Requires time or specific recovery actions.
    *   **Severe (6 shifts):** `Internal Bleeding`, `Maddened by Unreality`, `Spirit-Possessed`. A grave injury requiring significant recovery and often professional aid.

Consequences can be compelled by the GM, creating further complications until they are healed.

## Weaving the Veil: The Art of Magic

Magic in Umbraxis is the art of manipulating the Veil, the permeable barrier between reality and the Spirit World, guided by the dual influences of Auros and Phantasma. All magical actions primarily use the **Veilweaving** skill.

### The Two Weavings: Aurosian & Phantasmal

While `Veilweaving` is the skill used, the *intent* and *effect* of magic are colored by its connection to Auros or Phantasma. This choice is primarily narrative, driven by your character's focus, their **Aspects** (e.g., `Aurosian Scholar`, `Child of the Phantasma Shroud`), and the surrounding environment.

*   **Aurosian Weaving (Truthweaving):** Draws on the energies of Auros. Effects are often about clarity, revelation, stability, protection, direct force, and reinforcing existing truths.
    *   **Using Veilweaving with Aurosian Intent:**
        *   **Overcome:** Dispel illusions, purify tainted objects, stabilize crumbling structures, break curses, reveal hidden truths.
        *   **Create Advantage:** Create a `Zone of Clarity`, `Aurosian Barrier`, `Revealed Weakness` on an enemy, reinforce a true statement.
        *   **Attack:** Blast with pure Aurosian energy, inflict truth-induced pain.
        *   **Defend:** Ward against Phantasmal attacks, create a `Shield of Light`.
*   **Phantasmal Shaping (Illusion-Shaping):** Draws on the mutable, illusion-weaving energies of Phantasma. Effects are often about illusion, deception, sensory manipulation, influence, and altering perceptions.
    *   **Using Veilweaving with Phantasmal Intent:**
        *   **Overcome:** Create minor, temporary illusions to distract, navigate illusory mazes, subtly alter memories.
        *   **Create Advantage:** Generate a `Phantasmal Shroud` to hide, create `Distracting Illusions`, `Whispers of Doubt`, make a target `Blind to Reality`.
        *   **Attack:** Overwhelm senses with illusory pain, induce profound disorientation.
        *   **Defend:** Create `Decoy Images`, `Blurred Form` to evade attacks, subtly warp perceptions.

*Mechanics of Casting:* To perform a magical action, state your intent and which of the four FATE actions (Overcome, Create Advantage, Attack, Defend) you are attempting. You then roll `Veilweaving` + 4dF against the GM's difficulty or an opponent's defense. The success and failure outcomes follow standard FATE rules.

### The Veil's Repercussions: The Dangers of Magic

Pushing the Veil too hard, especially when its energies are turbulent, carries risks.

*   **Veil Strain (Stress & Consequences):** Attempting grand magical feats, overcoming extremely high difficulties with `Veilweaving` (e.g., attempting a roll with a target difficulty 3 or more higher than your skill), or pushing a spell's effect beyond its normal scope can inflict **Veil Strain**. This is typically represented as mental stress. If stress boxes are full, you must take a **Consequence** (e.g., `Overwhelmed by Energies` (Minor), `Visions of Unreality` (Moderate), `Spirit-Echoing Headache` (Severe)). These consequences are distinct from physical wounds and represent the psychic toll of magic.
*   **Paradox (Catastrophic Failure):** A **Paradox** occurs when a magical attempt fails catastrophically. This happens on a roll of `---` (all minuses on Fate dice) or if you fail a `Veilweaving` roll by 3 or more shifts, especially on a major magical endeavor. It also occurs if you take a **Severe Consequence** from Veil Strain.
    *   When a Paradox occurs, the GM introduces a new, temporary, and often problematic Aspect into the scene that reflects a chaotic, unpredictable reality shift. This might be beneficial in a twisted way, or a new hindrance.
    *   *Examples:* Instead of a wall of fire, the ground becomes `Suddenly Watery`. Your illusion makes you `Temporarily Invisible`, but also `Trapped in a Mirror Image`. The attempt to heal causes `Memory Bleed` in the target.

## The Spirit World

The Spirit World is a dimension of echoes, emotions, and raw spiritual energy that constantly presses against Umbraxis. It is largely unseen but its influence is ever-present.

*   **Influence:** The Spirit World can manifest as unsettling sensations, phantom sounds, or even bleed into reality, distorting perceptions or causing objects to glitch.
*   **Spirit-Sense Skill:** This skill is crucial for interacting with the Spirit World.
    *   **Overcome:** To find a hidden spirit, cross a spiritual barrier, or escape a spirit's grip.
    *   **Create Advantage:** To create an Aspect like `Spiritually Exposed` on a location or person, or to sense a `Lingering Echo of Trauma`.
    *   **Attack:** To inflict harm on incorporeal entities or minds.
    *   **Defend:** To resist spiritual possession, mental manipulation, or fear effects from spirits.
*   **Entering the Spirit World:** Directly entering the Spirit World is a perilous `Overcome` action, often requiring powerful `Veilweaving` or `Spirit-Sense` and specific ritual or location.
    *   **Success:** You successfully enter the Spirit World, perceiving its true nature and interacting with its inhabitants.
    *   **Success with a Cost:** You enter, but suffer a Consequence (e.g., `Disoriented by Echoes` (Minor)) or leave a trail that draws unwanted spiritual attention.
    *   **Failure:** You fail to enter, or are pushed back. You might suffer a minor consequence (e.g., `Veil Sickness`) or attract a negative spirit.

## Umbraxis-Specific Concepts

*   **The Bleeding Veil:** The boundary between Umbraxis and the Spirit World is thin and permeable, particularly in certain areas or during specific celestial alignments. This can lead to random, subtle distortions of reality or phantom sensations, manifesting as minor situational aspects (e.g., `Distorted Reflections`, `Unsettling Chill`).
*   **Phantasma Shrouds:** Areas where Phantasma's influence is dominant, often leading to shifting perceptions, illusory pathways, and a higher chance of Spirit World bleed-through. Actions relying on `Deceive`, `Stealth`, `Phantasmal Shaping` (Veilweaving), or `Spirit-Sense` might gain a bonus here (+1 or +2), while `Notice` (to see through illusions) and `Aurosian Weaving` (Veilweaving) might face increased difficulty (+1 or +2 to target, or -1 or -2 to your roll).
*   **Aurosian Glyphs:** Locations where Auros's truth and stability are powerfully channeled, often marked by ancient, glowing glyphs. These areas are resistant to illusion, promote clarity, and are often places of solace or protection. Actions relying on `Lore`, `Will`, `Aurosian Weaving` (Veilweaving), or `Notice` (to discern truth) might gain a bonus, while `Deceive` and `Phantasmal Shaping` (Veilweaving) might face increased difficulty.
*   **Societal Paranoia:** Centuries of mutable reality and the hidden influence of the Spirit World have bred deep distrust. This is a pervasive *truth* about Umbraxan society.
    *   **Default Social Aspect:** Many social interactions might start with a hidden or declared **Situational Aspect** like `Widespread Distrust` or `Everyone Has Secrets` that can be compelled by the GM.
    *   **Compels:** The GM may frequently offer compels that lead to suspicion, accusations, or misunderstandings, reflecting the pervasive paranoia. Accepting these grants Fate Points.
    *   **Increased Difficulty:** Building `Rapport` or using `Deceive` (to convincingly lie in crucial situations) might face a higher base difficulty (e.g., +1 or +2) if you don't have a strong Aspect or stunt to counter the suspicion.
